# Welcome to the Permissionless Prosperity Playbook

This project was started by [Elliott Payne](https://elliottpayne.com) and is informed by ongoing work he's doing with the City of Minneapolis [Innovation Team](http://innovateminneapolis.com) through his [consulting practice](https://www.sense-datum.com) supporting and encouraging minority and immigrant members of the community to start their own businesses. This playbook is inspired by the [PIE Cookbook](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook) and the [Startup Playbook](http://playbook.samaltman.com).

The Permissionless Prosperity Playbook differs from the PIE Cookbook and Startup Playbook in that its focus is on creating sustainable paths towards security and prosperity for individuals and communities as opposed to creating a Silicon Valley style startup whose purpose is to create a return on investment for venture capitalists.

## Current focus (Updated July 9th, 2020)

 **CURRENT VERSION:** **[PERMISSIONLESS PROSPERITY PLAYBOOK (Draft 0.3)](https://github.com/elliottpayne/permissionless-prosperity-playbook/blob/master/drafts/p3_drafts/permissionless-prosperity-playbook-0.3.md)** 

Currently focused on:

1. Reviewing forked PIE Cookbook content for relevancy
2. Removing content that doesn't serve the goals of this playbook (ex: content aligned with venture capital based startups)
3. Adding content relevant to the goals of this playbook


## Creating the Permissionless Prosperity Playbook

In the spirit of the [PIE Cookbook](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook) (which I highly recommend you read), this playbook will be an open source guide designed to help anyone, anywhere create a prosperous future for themselves and their community. Why create this? Because systems and institutions create too many barriers to prosperity. But with the right tools and community these barriers can be broken down and overcome. 

By joining this project, you’ll gain access to everything learned from nearly a decade of accelerating startups, building relationships that strengthen community, and facilitating creative output from the authors of the PIE Cookbook and you'll learn how apply insights and practices from the startup world to creating prosperity for yourself and your community. Since this is an open source project — you’ll have the opportunity take part in creating the most effective documentation for defining and pursuing prosperity for yourself and your community.
