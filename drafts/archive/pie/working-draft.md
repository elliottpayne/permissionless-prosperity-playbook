# PIE Cookbook



~~## Preface ~~
~~> It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the time. I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning. But as the summer progressed we were increasingly impressed by how well the startups were doing.… When people came to YC to speak at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone coming to address a Boy Scout troop. By the time they left the building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these companies might actually succeed."~~

~~> - Paul Graham, [How Y Combinator Started](http://old.ycombinator.com/start.html)~~

~~This cookbook all began simply enough. As a way of formalizing the mechanics and processes of the PIE program. In case one of us, as the euphemism goes, got hit by a bus. Painfully.~~

~~But once we started working on it. And building it out. We realized that we were actually beginning to scratch the surface of something much larger. Something far more compelling. ~~

~~What we had hit upon — unbeknownst to us at the time — was a framework for anyone, anywhere to start building a startup accelerator. ~~

~~Or, perhaps even more generically, a way for people to accelerate creative output. ~~

~~As with framework, we were curious as to whether what we had built would have value for others. Was it repeatable? Where were our blind spots? Could others improve upon our initial learnings? Suffice it to say, we had tons of questions. ~~

~~So drawing on our Portland open source roots, we began to think of this as something bigger than PIE. And what better way to enable folks from all communities to join us in taking on that challenge than to open source the document? An open invitation for others to provide feedback and insights for the greater good. And a starting point — a baseline — from which we could continue to iterate, test, and revise much as we would with any startup. Or experiment. ~~

~~Because the best thing about experiments is that whether you succeed or fail you always, always, always learn something.~~

~~Welcome to the PIE Cookbook.~~

~~### Caveats~~

~~I have always been a fan of books that start with a caveat or two. Because inevitably, you, gentle reader, have just started down this path. And given that you've already started to get a feel for where this is going, you're inevitably jumping to the question: Is this book for me?~~

~~The answer is yes. But with a few caveats.~~

~~#### 1. This is not a problem technology can solve. ~~

~~If technology could solve this problem, we would have built it. Trust us. But it can't. This isn't about algorithms or dynamically connecting dots. This is about getting to know people. And what makes them tick. And what pisses them off. And what scares them. This is about seeing non-obvious connections. It is about using what artists refer to as "negative space." Finding opportunity in what is absent or invisible.   ~~
~~  ~~
~~> Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.  ~~
~~  ~~
~~> The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word "ma" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.  ~~
~~  ~~
~~> - ["Negative space" in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space)  ~~
~~  ~~
~~So if you're looking for a way to throw technology at the problem and avoid the messy feels and stuff, it's probably best to stop reading here and starting searching the web for what you think you need.~~

~~![All the feels](/source/images/all-the-feels.jpg "All the feels")~~
~~ ~~
~~#### 2. This is not a scalable solution. ~~

~~This is the very reason we're not seeking to stamp out a ton of cookie cutter versions of PIE. Because our way of doing this doesn't scale. Well, that and "cookie cutter" and "PIE" is a mixed metaphor. We don't believe you can recreate what we created to solve Portland, Oregon's technology startup problem late in the first decade of this century. Nor would we want you to.     ~~
~~  ~~
~~It's not that we haven't tried. We have. But each time, it comes out differently. Because the community the each accelerator model supports needs it to be different. ~~

~~Again, if your hope is to find some easily repeatable way of doing this, the way is shut. It was made by those who are communities. And the communities keep it. The way is shut. ~~

~~![The way is shut](/source/images/way-is-shut.gif "The way is shut")~~

~~#### 3. This is not an efficient solution. ~~

~~Given the first two caveats, it is appropriate to assume the third — and potentially most obvious — caveat, that one of how time consuming this is. It doesn't scale. There are no technology shortcuts. It takes time. But none of it is wasted. Even if you're making mistakes. Because it is through that process of trying, iterating, changing, and learning that you will manage to build the best accelerator for your community — no matter what that community happens to be.~~

~~#### 4. Be intentional~~

~~So much of what occurs in an accelerator environment appears to happen organically and dynamically. But appearances, as they say, can be deceiving. And can belie all of the prior effort that has been invested prior to the accelerator environment.~~

~~To be successful, you must be intentional. And work with the intent of making stuff happen. Not just letting stuff happen.~~

~~## Format~~

~~We’ve structured this as a cookbook for an accelerator. And admittedly, we may have been a little heavy handed with that whole analogy. Sorry. That’s just how we roll. But you’ll get used to it. ~~

~~At least, we’re not subjecting you to the endless stream of idiotic pie related puns we bandy about on a daily basis. So be thankful for that. ~~

~~Besides, it seemed to be a really compelling way to get you from the first taste of an accelerator to, well, dessert. ~~

~~And honestly, when it comes right down to it? You’ll quickly realize that every founder has the exact same personality traits as a temperamental chef. Obsessed with perfection. Driven to succeed. Shouldering the brunt of every criticism no matter how seemingly minute.~~

~~And loving what they do. Not matter how hard and painful it is to foster the creation of something amazing.  ~~

~~One of the most important headings you’ll find throughout the cookbook will be labeled “Mistakes were made.” This is where PIE screwed up, tripped, or outright failed. Why is this critical? Because you can follow the recipe word for word and never accurately recreate PIE. But you can always learn from our mistakes.~~

~~You’ll also see sections labeled “Happy accidents.” These are times where we tried something random or accidentally discovered a benefit through absolutely no planning whatsoever. It just sort of happened. Salt fell in the pot and it just tasted better. And it helped. And hopefully it will help you. And inspire you to take random risks of your own.~~

~~Finally, we’ll do our best to share all of the ingredients, preparations, step-by-step instructions, and intended results of these recipes. And if we don’t do that terribly well? Tell us. And we’ll fix it. For everyone. ~~

~~Note: Your flavors of PIE will vary. In fact, they must vary. If they don’t, you’re likely doing it wrong.~~

~~**Building a studio**~~

~~When it comes right down to it, all we’ve done at PIE is figure out a way to create a protected and trusted environment for creative people to try new things — and potentially fail. It’s like any artist’s studio. ~~

~~## PIE as an example~~

~~> My hope is that you do not view the use of Boulder here as "Boulder tooting its own horn." I use Boulder as an example of a lasting and vibrant startup community because I know it extremely well (at least one segment). This approach is called synecdoche, where the part stands for the whole. There are many things the Boulder startup community can do better and many more for it to discovers we continue on our journey; my hope is that by exploring it in depth it helps you with your journey in your startup community.~~

~~> - Brad Feld in Startup Communities~~

~~Throughout this book, you’ll find us using PIE as an example. I mean, I guess it makes sense. It’s the accelerator we know best. But please keep in mind that references to PIE are meant to serve as that and only that. An example. ~~

~~It’s not doctrine. Or a specific recipe. Or maybe even the right way to do things. In fact, we’ll highlight—on any number of occasions—how it was absolutely not the right way to do things.~~

~~Please don’t think that we’re purporting to have the only recipe for an accelerator. Because we don’t. And if that’s what you’re hoping to get out of this book, then you should probably stop reading right now.~~

~~Because there are plenty of ways for you to start an accelerator based solely on someone else’s model. And there are any number of successful accelerators that have programs to help you do this. There are also any number of curricula available for purchase that will arm you to deliver their prescribed way of learning.~~

~~And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with taking those paths to an accelerator. For many, that is the only viable way of effectively achieving the goals they are trying to meet. ~~

~~But that’s not what this book is designed to do. Far from it.~~

~~What this book is designed to do is quite simple. We’re going to teach you to fish.~~

~~We simply wanted to provide some contextual evidence for our learnings at PIE, the majority of which will be purely anecdotal. This is a conceit to bring our theoretical guidance into more tactical applications. And to prove to you that we screwed up a lot, made a ton of mistakes, and got lucky in any number of ways. ~~

~~And it’s important to note that we have realized these concepts not only in the context of early stage technology startups. Yes, we’ve spent the majority of our time and learning applying these techniques to early stage tech startups. But we’ve also experimented with these techniques on nonprofits, open source projects, and solo founders. We’ve applied these techniques to more traditional creative pursuits. We’ve even had opportunities to test these processes on internal employee teams as a means of driving innovation throughout large corporations. ~~

~~Long story short, there are any number of ways to apply the concepts of trust, pressure, and mentorship to any number of creative pursuits. To accelerate creative output. ~~

~~But our context for this experimentation has always been PIE. And in order for PIE to make sense as a point of reference, you need to understand a little bit of the history of the organization. And also recognize that, much like you, we started by simply taking what others were doing, using that as a framework for something different, and iterating from there. ~~

~~While we’ll get into specific elements of the program, its composition, and its multiple iterations throughout the book, here is some grounding in where this whole thing started.~~

~~## [SIDEBAR] No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. ~~
~~[Source](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05 "Permalink to No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. — Portland Incubator Experiment — Medium")~~

~~### Our motivation to[ share the PIE Cookbook][10] isn't to convince you to recreate[ PIE][11]. It's to inspire you to create something new — and better.~~

~~I was having a conversation with a friend, recently. Given that we're both startup types, the topic of conversation eventually gravitated to the [PIE Cookbook][10] project.~~

~~His response? An unadulterated "Meh."~~

~~I paused.~~

~~I mean, he's a serial entrepreneur. He's been mentored. He's been a mentor. He's seen a bunch of startups. He's currently working for a startup — that went through an accelerator.~~

~~Why wasn't this concept super interesting to him?~~

~~The reason — it didn't take me long to realize — is because the thought of starting some also-ran tech startup accelerator isn't terribly interesting to most people these days.~~

~~And then it dawned on me. The idea of convincing others to build some preconceived, generic tech accelerator hosting a hodgepodge of startups, in this day and age, wasn't even a concept that motivated or interested me.~~

~~Furthermore, it occurred to me as we continued the conversation that we, as PIE, had just assumed — or taken for granted — that our true motivations for creating the PIE Cookbook were obvious. And that our hopes for this next phase of the ongoing experiment were clear.~~

~~**They're not.**~~

~~So let's be clear. Inspiring the creation of a bunch of generic startup accelerators is not — at all — how we hope people will use the PIE Cookbook. Trust us.~~

~~But at first blush, I realize that's exactly what it looks like we were trying to do. And with this new vantage, I recognize how our prevailing assumptions, today's startup rat race, and our lack of clarity may lead to a very flawed first impression of the PIE Cookbook.~~

~~That's our fault. So I'd like to ask you to please take a moment to look deeper.~~

~~### PIE is actually an experiment in accelerating creativity~~

~~When[ Renny][12] reached out to me to start the conversation that would eventually become PIE, he had one very clear hypothesis he was interested in testing:~~

~~> Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don't always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as "creative." But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it's important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who've chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.~~

~~And that hypothesis has remained a guiding principle for PIE for nearly a decade. First as a coworking space then as a startup accelerator then as a means of effecting more compelling collaborations between corporations and startups. But through and through, we've always been about creating innovation communities and accelerating creative output.~~

~~The PIE Cookbook is no different.~~

~~### It's your job to improve upon the recipe~~

~~With that in mind, please don't try to recreate PIE. In fact, we would hate for you to bake our flavor of PIE. This isn't a sleeve of prepared cookie dough that you halfheartedly slice onto a cookie sheet. This is a "Bake your own" proposition. This is a recipe. And everyone has their own unique ingredients.~~

~~This is about rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands in the mix. Making the recipe yours. Experimenting, manipulating, iterating, exploring, and improving.~~

~~The world needs more variety — not less. And together, we all get better.~~

~~Therefore, we'd like to ask: How might the PIE recipe be adapted to meet your community's needs?~~

~~Maybe you could…~~

~~* Use the PIE recipe to create an environment that focuses on companies engaged in services-based businesses — read "not candidates for equity investment." Maybe you could create ways to better meet their unique business needs? And maybe you could create entirely new ways of investing in and evaluating these companies? You could. Because that's exactly what[ Oregon Story Board][13] is doing with the PIE recipe, as it accelerates companies in the world of digital storytelling. All of which enabled them to be among Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, UC Berkeley, and Virginia Tech as an[ early stage grantee for Microsoft HoloLens][14].~~
~~* Leverage the PIE model to focus on issues that are adversely impacting your community. Like lack of inclusion. And ineffective support for women founders. Maybe you could use it to raise the visibility of a whole ton of awesome founders from communities of color? Maybe this effort could be part of a broader economic plan to make your entire community a better place to live? You could. Because that's how the [Portland Development Commission][15] is adapting the PIE recipe to guide and accelerate companies in the[ Startup PDX Challenge][16].~~
~~* Identify the compelling knowledge and resources your community has accumulated. And look for ways to activate that knowledge by using an a PIE-flavored accelerator to focus that energy. That expertise could be geographical. It could be cultural. It could be the business environment, itself. You could. Because that's exactly what the town of Newberg, Oregon — the gateway to the Willamette Valley wine country — is doing with the[ Newberg Innovation Accelerator][17], a project that will focus efforts on agricultural technology projects and businesses that directly impact the wine industry.~~
~~* Use the PIE recipe as means of changing the way employees approach, attack, and resolve problems within a corporation. You could bring a cross-functional team of folks from throughout the company to a shared communal workspace that resembles an accelerator. To work for three months on an entrenched problem, free from the typical approval cycles and sacred cows of corporate life. To get them out of the building and get them engaged with real customers. To hear, firsthand, how they can fix things. You could. Because that's exactly what[ Daimler][18]** did with their SPIN program**, by using the PIE recipe to create an internal accelerator. For employees.~~
~~* Or maybe you could come up with something completely unique. Maybe you could use the PIE recipe to build new curricula at a college. Or to create a nonprofit accelerator. Or to change the dynamic of an R&amp;D shop. Or to rethink craft brewing. Or to create agencies. Or to help Kickstarter projects survive, post funding. Or to change the world of VR. Or to help bloggers build better business models. Or to give artists an environment to create. Or to help a diverse slice of indie game developers change the face of gaming. Or to build a maker space. Or to help lifestyle companies succeed more efficiently. Or or or or…~~

~~The point is that the PIE Cookbook is designed to inspire you to do something. To help you frame up your organization, your community, and yourself. To give you a pattern for what success might look like. And how to budget for chaos, random constructive collisions, and innovation. To get creative. Not repetitive.~~

~~The PIE Cookbook is designed to help provide a framework and some confidence. To give you courage. [To provide suggestions][19] and inspiration. It's designed to help you understand — or to educate your superiors — that it's actually okay to try this stuff. To show them it's not just acceptable to participate, but it's exciting and critical to survival as well. The PIE Cookbook is our way of telling you to step off that cliff and go for it.~~

~~Not interested in building a generic tech startup accelerator? Good. Please don't. [Go do something more interesting than that][10].~~

~~And, by all means, please keep us in the loop. We're looking forward to learning from — and with — you.~~

~~## Motivations~~

~~It seems a lot of folks want to build an accelerator to somehow create a startup community from scratch. Unfortunately, that's not really how this thing works. ~~

~~An accelerator can attract a community. An accelerator can codify a community. An accelerator can even import a community. But an accelerator has to have a community. ~~

~~Building an accelerator is not a means of creating a community from scratch. Building an accelerator is a means of accelerating or capitalizing on the momentum of an existing community, identifying and enabling community leaders, and providing infrastructure for supporters and contributors to engage, thereby enabling all parties, throughout the community, to focus everyone's efforts to the greatest benefit — and highest likelihood of success — for that community.~~

~~The best accelerators spring up from communities. Great communities can form around accelerators, but they need a seed community from which to spring.~~

~~If you don't have an existing community, keep this in mind when you're deciding on the focus of your accelerator. Because if you don't have a community then your accelerator needs to be attractive enough to recruit a community around it.~~

~~## Understanding — and working within — the existing culture of the community~~

~~Every accelerator needs a community. Every community does not need an accelerator.~~

~~Communities exist on a spectrum. Some communities don't even realize that they're communities. Others are a loosely assembled group of individuals who identify with peers and members of their community through a feeling of commonality and affinity, even though they lack definition, infrastructure, and process for formalizing that community. Still other communities are well defined, organized, and managed as communities.~~

~~[PLACEHOLDER] Provide analogies/examples of each of the communities above.~~

~~When it comes to accelerators, no one type of community has a particular advantage over any other. They all have their respective pros and cons.~~

~~Amorphous and nebulous communities, for example, have the benefit of needing the structure accelerators bring to a community. That's an upside. No pre-existing conditions or competition or toes on which to step. That's awesome. On the downside, these ill defined communities are — well — ill defined. As such, they don't have easily accessible resources into which an accelerator can immediately tap. The onus, therefore, is on the accelerator to create these assets and resources from scratch.~~

~~Conversely, a well established community — on the upside — could have a wealth of infrastructure and programmatic elements which can be leveraged by an accelerator. While on the downside, it may have pre-existing and well established players, organizations, and cultural mores that prevent an accelerator from being as effective as it can be — without spending significant political capital to navigate the existing infrastructure.~~

~~See? Pros and cons. No community is perfect.~~

~~What we're saying is that the community doesn't have to be a certain kind of community to support the concept of an accelerator. It simply has to exist. As a community. Even if the members of said community are still not fully cognizant of the community's existence or their inclusion therein.~~

~~If you, as the accelerator perceive something that behaves like community — no matter how ill defined — then there's enough there to begin.~~

~~### Accelerators function within communities~~

~~Accelerators can be a means of bringing an existing — but nebulous and ill defined — community together. Or accelerating the momentum of an organized community.~~

~~But make no mistakes. Accelerators are not a means of creating a community from scratch. And this is an assumption that most people make. Many potential accelerator founders are enamored of the concept of creating an accelerator that will somehow result in the creation of an amazing and vibrant community. It's actually the converse that is true.~~

~~Community first. Accelerator second.~~

~~To be successful, you must work within the context and culture of your existing community. You're not going to be successful trying to build something that flies in the face of the community in which you're trying to build it.~~

~~## Current state of accelerators ~~

~~While PIE will speak from its vantage point on its experience as coworking space, a community hub, and an early stage tech startup accelerator, the PIE Cookbook is not meant to be tech specific. Nor is it meant to be a guide that only applies to startups.~~
~~ ~~
~~We believe that the accelerator model is a powerful and efficient educational construct to can be applied to a variety of markets, businesses, and communities. ~~

~~We believe that no one has perfected it yet. So you should feel free to adapt and revise it as you see fit. ~~

~~We believe that the accelerator market is currently like the search engine market pre-Google. There are lots of well meaning people sort of doing things right but no one has really hit upon a repeatable and successful formula for doing this.~~

~~Remember pre-Google Web? Well if you don’t, suffice it to say that there were a few choices for searching the Web, back in the day. Like hundreds. And no single one had significant traction. Mostly because they were all variations on a theme. Some were directories. Some were aggregators. Some were really, really smart algorithms. Many of them were wildly successful at the time. But none of them had really nailed the way to find the most relevant information on the Web. That’s kind of where we are with accelerators, today. And I’m hopeful that getting more smart people thinking about the model will help us find a better way of doing this. For everyone. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p~~

~~Using higher education as an analogy, accelerators have our Harvard and Stanford. We have our Oxford. But where our state schools? Our small private liberal arts colleges? Where are our vocational schools and community colleges? We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface for this educational model.~~

~~As far as accelerators go, we have our Ivy Leagues and our Stanford, but we have barely begun to scratch the surface for this educational model. Where is the Georgia Tech of accelerators? Where is the RISD? Where is the Reed or Whitman? Better yet, where is the state school or community college or junior college? Where is the vocational school of accelerators? There’s still plenty of room to explore this educational model. We have a long way to go before we’ve even leveraged the existing model, let alone begun to inflate the bubble. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p~~

~~## Spoiler alert~~

~~This document is full of "spoiler alerts," things that PIE has learned over the course of time. In most every case, it may not be wise — or downright foolhardy — to start where PIE ended. You should start where PIE started. And try to end where you want to end. ~~

~~There is inherent value in the journey, itself.~~

~~Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for disaster. ~~

~~Accelerators don't start communities. Communities start accelerators.~~

~~Your accelerator should be a reflection of your community — or the community you want to attract. ~~

~~In other words, don't try to build an accelerator that doesn't have a target community. ~~

~~For PIE, that target community was the startup community that was beginning to form in Portland. It was the combination of the open source community, a nascent group of early stage companies who were seeking assistance and capital, and a group of experienced startup folks who were looking for a means of giving back to the community. Folks who were willing to share their expertise if only there were a means of doing that.~~

~~- It's a means of catalyzing existing community~~
~~- Be honest about your community~~
~~- You can only work with what you've got~~
~~- You have to start with the ingredients your community has, but you don't need to follow the existing community momentum~~
~~- You're allowed to bring different ingredients into the community, but the initial activity must start with existing assets~~
~~- Some of your community assets may have never combined before (e.g., Portland startup community and W+K), but they're still both assets to be considered~~

~~It is incredibly difficult to do virtual communities well. Not loosely affiliated social networks. Clearly folks have managed to do that. But communities. Actual interacting and collaborating communities. Groups of people who share common interests, work toward common goals, and support one another. ~~

~~In our experience, this kind of activity does not happen out in the ether. It happens somewhere. Physically and personally. Community, we believe, needs a place. ~~

~~And this has come into sharp relief as we've moved away from PIE being a physical presence. We've learned that not having a physical space has actually weakened our ability to scale and the strength of our connections. The more we rely on virtual, the more it makes it difficult to accomplish the things our community needs. ~~

~~Long story short, we greatly underestimated the positive impact and community benefits of having an actual physical place. That's why we're working to correct that. To return to PIE being less virtual and more physical. Because our community needs that physical space.~~

~~#### Community, then accelerator~~

~~Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for complete failure. For that reason, we'll cover ways to discover, identify, engage with, and collaborate with your community prior to beginning your accelerator effort.~~

~~#### Just enough~~
~~You can go too far.~~
~~* In design~~
~~* In environment~~
~~* In structure~~
~~* In goals~~
~~* In trying to over architect the experience~~
~~* In over planning and under participating~~

~~This is meant to be a little messy.~~

~~#### There is no pause button~~

~~Once you start, you cannot stop. Ever.~~

~~## How to use this cookbook~~

~~Like many cookbooks, there’s no one way to use this book. But we have designed it with two particular use cases in mind:~~

~~1. If you are intrigued by the idea of starting an accelerator but have absolutely no idea where to start—or, worse yet, are paralyzed by a fear of failure that’s preventing you from taking the leap—this book will guide you step-by-step through the iterations that PIE followed, highlighting mistakes we made along the way and culminating with the process we use to run our accelerator today.  ~~
~~2. If you have already started an accelerator but are feeling like you could be doing better, this book will allow you to jump to sections that apply to specific areas of your program that you’re looking to improve. ~~

~~Like any cookbook, this book provides the recipes that worked for PIE. They may or may not work for your organization. And your special adaptations are what make the recipe work for you. ~~

~~With that in mind, it is our intention to:~~

~~- Arm you with enough knowledge to be dangerous. And to break things.~~
~~- Give you enough insight into our process for you to internalize it, change it, and create your own way of doing things.~~
~~- Encourage you to communicate back to us what worked and what didn’t. So that we can create a more compelling cookbook for everyone that is just as crazy as we are.~~


~~## Open Source~~

~~We are releasing this information as an open source project for a reason. Because we want this to be a conversation. ~~

~~This isn't a broadcast or soliloquy. It's a collaboration among communities. That's why it is equally important that your provide feedback. What was helpful? What worked? What didn't work? What was complete malarkey? Where was PIE’s experience a matter of timing and luck, rather than repeatable? How did you do things differently?~~

~~(Footnote: https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05#.7ybyv2grm)~~


~~> “So with the PIE Cookbook, getting the chance to actually help lead an open source project…? That’s been a long time coming for me. I’m looking forward to learning — and probably making some mistakes. But no matter what, I’m really interested in seeing where the community takes this project.”~~

~~## History~~

~~In that same vein, we are providing the PIE history as an example or parable, not a step-by-step, cookie cutter process for you to follow to achieve the same ends. ~~

~~It is important to note that, like many things in the world of startups, PIE worked at a moment in time, because of the people involved, and the way the world happened to be going in Portland, Oregon, with open source, technology, startups, blogging, and creative agencies. ~~

~~To put it another way, the way PIE came into being and worked would likely not work if we tried to do the same thing today. Too many things have changed. There is no way to recreate those random collisions of things. Or to recreate that period in time.~~

~~That said, your community is likely at a different place. Maybe there are similarities to our experience or moment in time. Maybe there are companies or individuals we’ll reference in the PIE Cookbook who remind you of someone in your community. ~~

~~Whatever the case, we are hopeful that our history with PIE provides reference points that allow you to better identify — and take advantage of — potential opportunities in your community, today.~~

~~## Recipes~~

~~We don't expect you to follow these recipes step by step. This isn't a science experiment. This is sustenance for your community. And as such, it needs to taste the way your community wants it to taste. ~~

~~We expect you to make these recipes your own. Maybe you like more salt or more spice. Do what works for your community. ~~

~~### Jump around as needed. Choose your own adventure.~~

~~This isn’t a book you read cover to cover. ~~

~~Some of this will seem obvious to you. If it is? Skip it. ~~

~~Sometimes you’ll need to start later in the book and work your way backwards.~~

~~Start with what you have. Go from there.~~

~~## Definitions~~

~~We feel that it is extremely important to have a consistent set of language to describe the concepts and participants in this process. Without clear definitions, we run the risk of miscommunication — even when we think that we’re speaking the same language.~~

~~For that reason, we're going to provide you with some definitions of terms that are regularly used throughout the PIE Cookbook. Please note that, like all things in this document, we are simply providing this as a reference. We would encourage you to create your own set of definitions for your specific needs.~~

~~### Community~~
~~Community can refer to any group of individuals who hold common goals and are motivated to collaborate to achieve those goals. There is no specified size for a community. And communities can be nested within other communities — or overlap. Therefore, it is always important to test the assumptions of toward what the "community" is working.~~

~~> e.g., The Portland technology community has subsets like the Portland open source community and the Portland tech startup community. There is significant crossover between the open source community and the tech startup community, but they do not share exactly the same goals.~~

~~A community simply has to have a focus. It can revolve around concepts, ideals, goals, brands, or any combination thereof. We see community, at its essence, as a group of people with a shared, collaborative vision.~~

~~### Incubator~~
~~An incubator is a protected work environment designed to shelter founders and ideas as they work to realize concepts and prototypes. There is no "business" yet. There are simply ideas and potential. ~~

~~Incubators are designed to help early stage ideas survive longer than they would in the wild, independent of shelter. As such, an incubator does not accurately reflect the stressors and turmoil of the real world. Instead, it seeks to shield founders from reality by providing resources that best ensure its likelihood of finding commercial applications of its concept(s). This is by design.~~

~~> e.g., University tech transfer programs tend to be a good example of incubators~~

~~Although PIE has "incubator" in its name, that's a misnomer. We simply couldn't come up with a phrase that worked for PAELLA.~~

~~### Accelerator~~
~~An accelerator is a semi-protective environment that behaves as a microcosm of the real world, at a highly increased rate of speed. It is designed to help founders rapidly address issues impacting their businesses — and help them to better understand how to deal with personalities and adversity in the real world.  ~~

~~> Accelerators are not designed to protect founders from the elements of the startup world. They are designed to expose founders to those elements, time and time again in rapid succession. ~~

~~To quote Techstars, accelerators, by their very nature, are designed to help companies "do more, faster." They are designed to make founders uncomfortable. And to push founder to do and achieve more — or fail — more rapidly than they would be capable of on their own.~~

~~### Mentor~~
~~### Advisor~~

~~- - - -~~

~~# [SIDEBAR] Do you need a Mentor or do you need an Advisor?~~

~~Like many industries, the startup world is rife with terminology that holds special meaning to individuals who are well versed in its own cryptic lexicon. For that reason, we often fall into situations where we assume we’re on the same page as one of our similarly immersed counterparts. And — like most assumptions — that can cause problems. We believe that communication and clarity are vital, so we’re always looking for ways to get everyone speaking the same language.~~

~~One area of muddy definitions and confusion that we encounter time and time again is with “Mentors” and “Advisors.” In the vein of clarification, we thought we would take a few minutes to split hairs and explain the difference between these two roles, from a PIE perspective.~~

~~> The primary difference between a mentor and an advisor is that the former is chiefly tasked with providing opinions on problems and the latter is tasked with resolving those issues.~~

~~## Mentors~~

~~Obviously, as an early stage startup accelerator, we spend far more time with mentors than advisors. In our world, we define a Mentor as an individual who volunteers his or her time to provide a startup with opinions, criticism, and feedback on problems, opportunities, or quandaries.~~

~~Mentors tend to provide feedback in the form of “If I were in your shoes…”, “Here’s what I’d suggest…”, or “I remember being in a similar situation. Here’s how we handled it….”~~

~~Therefore, mentors should…~~

~~- Give first~~
~~- Volunteer their feedback free of charge~~
~~- Provide feedback on a wide range of issues and opportunities with the startup~~
~~- Speak from previous experience tempered with a knowledge of current market conditions~~
~~- Openly share mistakes and missteps from their past experience~~
~~- Remove their “brand hat” or “title” as needed, i.e., sometimes a mentor is “a CEO” and sometimes that same mentor is simply a “user,” “successful business person,” or “someone who has seen a lot.”~~
~~- Float in and out of a startup’s purview, enabling the mentor to provide fresh perspectives on problems as they change~~
~~- Be used en masse to simultaneously provide a variety of viewpoints on specific problems or opportunities — the more opinions, the better— even if it winds up causing the classic “[mentor whiplash](http://avc.com/2013/07/mentorinvestor-whiplash/)”~~

~~## Advisors~~

~~Conversely, we define an Advisor as an individual who is compensated —either in the form of equity or cash — by a startup in exchange for effort on solving a specific issue with the company or who is charged with assisting the founding team with a variety of issues.~~

~~Therefore, advisors should…~~

~~- Always be compensated for their efforts~~
~~- Work to earn that compensation~~
~~- Focus on specific areas that are in the advisor’s wheelhouse~~
~~- Provide strategic value to the startup that is recognizable to potential investors or other advisors~~
~~- Be expected to contribute effort to solving problems~~
~~- Be held accountable for contributing time to the helping a startup make progress or resolve issues~~
~~- Be used by the startup in a fashion that is equitable to the amount of compensation~~
~~- Provide more than advice or guidance~~
~~- Continue to provide value to the startup throughout their tenure~~

~~## Pick the right person for the job~~

~~To recap, if you’re working with a mentor, ask them for advice, not effort. They’re volunteers. They’re not being paid to help you. They’re providing their insights with the hopes that others will not have to suffer the same pains the mentor has.~~

~~If you’re working with an advisor, it’s fine to ask for advice, but you should also expect them to do work — and hold them accountable to that expectation. And you should recognize that they are a direct reflection on you and your company. Don’t take on advisors on a whim. Anymore so than you would take on a cofounder lightly.~~

~~Mentors volunteer; advisors are paid. Mentors advise; advisors work.~~

~~## History of PIE~~

~~# History of PIE~~

~~## Overview~~

~~PIE began as a collaborative experiment between award-winning, global advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy and the Portland high-tech startup community. Now, PIE has evolved into an intensive three-month mentorship program designed to identify, recruit, capitalize, accelerate, and promote early stage high-tech startups which are highly efficient with investment capital, establish corporate headquarters in Oregon, create high paying jobs for Oregonians, and raise the visibility of the state on an international stage. ~~

~~The PIE model has been tested, refined, and proven over a three-year period. During that time, the program has fostered the growth of companies that have attracted more than $50 million in venture capital and created more than 150 Oregon jobs with wages averaging nearly double the baseline of the average Oregon family wage of $40,486. In addition, PIE has had the opportunity to work with corporations like Intel, Target, Coca-Cola, and Google raising the visibility of both the State of Oregon and its innovative technology community to international acclaim. ~~

~~Like the startups the program serves, PIE is extremely efficient with capital. All activity to date has been accomplished with minimal capital investment. This is thanks in part to the creative efforts of the PIE team to leverage volunteer resources, actively seek and secure in-kind contributions, and create and manage additional revenue-generating programs beyond its incubation activities.~~

~~## A melding of hypotheses~~

~~> Portland, Oregon, boasts more microbreweries, restaurants, food carts, batch distilleries, mobile startups, and open source user groups per capita than any city in the world. Some call it the most entrepreneurial city, ever. It's determined to be the most green, friendly, sustainable, bike commutable, soccer loving, and livable town you'll ever encounter. And if that's not good enough for you, it's 90 minutes from the ocean and 90 minutes from skiing and snowboarding, year round.~~

~~> But most importantly, it's the best place in the world for you to build your startup dream into a reality. To make your startup work. To make it.~~

~~> - PIE, circa 2011~~

~~So I guess you're wondering… what on earth motivated the largest privately held — and exceptionally successful — creative agency in the world to start mucking around in the world of startups? ~~

~~Well, this whole crazy experiment started quite simply. With a hypothesis. ~~

~~It's a hypothesis that founders — be they executives, developers, designers, or any combination there of — are simply another form of creative. No different than someone who paints or writes or shoots film. A creative who, instead of words and images, has chosen technology as a medium for expression. ~~

~~And like any creative, they need space to create.~~

~~And in having a space — actual physical space — you have the opportunity to put people in that space. To put those disparate groups of creatives within close proximity to one another. And in so doing, you create the opportunity for random collisions. And serendipity. From the collisions come collaborations and friction and conflict and resolution. Resulting in interesting outcomes. And demonstrating significant impact.  ~~

~~But what attracted the startup community to participate in the project? Well, startups are opportunistic. Tentative but opportunistic. Quick to capitalize. But slow to trust. ~~

~~And the startup community came to the table with a hypothesis of their own. That the community had the opportunity to "Build better founders." To share knowledge and support one another. To provide a framework for mentors to engage with those who needed mentorship. To collaborate and share skill sets. ~~

~~So we took those complementary hypotheses and started testing them. Carving off a little corner in a building full of disparate creatives driven by a willingness to experiment and collaborate — and potential fail.  ~~

~~Our hope was that by building better founders and enabling creatives to collide, we had the potential to artificially accelerate the startup community in Portland. And to make it easier to build a company in the city that had long been seen as a flyover town between the larger, more active startup scenes in the Bay Area and Seattle. ~~

~~## A timeline~~

~~The PIE accelerator, unbeknownst to us, started in 1995, 15 years before PIE officially became an accelerator. It started when members of the startup community started careers and built networks of peers in the dotcom days. Where classmates at our universities explored technology together. Where agencies and creative community grew in strength and numbers. Where companies had been founded and demolished. Where the open source community had created connections and collaborations. ~~

~~It took all of those things — and a growing sense of community — to start conversations. Conversations about "What if…?" What is the community had a collaborative workspace? What if there were a way for the community to have a more physical and tangible presence? What if we had a community hub that gave more gravity to what we sensed was happening?~~

~~But communicating that need to others was challenging. No one built startups in Portland, Oregon. Maybe food carts. But not tech startups. ~~

~~This wasn't even perceived as a problem. It wasn't pervasive. There weren't a ton of people who agreed with that viewpoint.~~

~~It was a non-obvious problem. And equally non-obvious was the potential opportunity.~~

~~So funding the effort was going to be a challenge. And with no active early stage investor presence — coupled with the nascent community — it would be incredibly difficult to make the argument. And it was simply too much for us to bootstrap. Even as a community.~~

~~Enter [Wieden+Kennedy](http://wk.com/).~~

~~Wieden+Kennedy — which we may also refer to as W+K or Wieden, throughout the PIE Cookbook — is the largest privately held creative agency in the world, perhaps best known for creative efforts such as Nike’s “[Just Do It](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/happy-25th-birthday-nikes-just-do-it-last-great-advertising-slogan-150947),” the [Old Spice Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE), and Chrysler’s “[Imported from Detroit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL254Y_jtc),” among others. The worldwide headquarters of the agency are located not in New York, Chicago, or London, but in Portland’s Pearl District, where a former Fuller Brush Company warehouse holds more than 500 of their employees. The remainder of their creative talent lives around the world, gathering in offices in Amsterdam, Delhi, London, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Tokyo.  ~~

~~And in 2009 — thanks to economic doldrums and a horrible real estate market — W+K had an empty retail space sitting vacant on the first floor. ~~

~~The project didn’t even have a name at the time. It was just “the startup thing at 1227 NW Davis Street.” It would be come to known as the Portland Incubator Experiment or more commonly as “PIE,” a collaboration between members of the Portland tech startup community and Wieden+Kennedy.~~

~~I can still remember the handful of us, standing in a small circle, on the empty concrete of 3500 cavernous and columned square feet of potential.~~

~~![Sketch of the floor plan after walking through the space](/source/images/PIE-sketch-2009.jpg)~~

~~We've talked to any number of people who are overly concerned with the space. Or its appointments. We're firm believers that you work with what you've got. ~~

~~We had a former retail space that had been gutted. So it was huge columns, a concrete floor, high ceilings, and a cryptic set of light switches we never really figured out how to operate.~~

~~![PIE's nonsensical light switches](/source/images/pie-light-switches-xolotl.jpg)~~

~~It was raw. And unfinished. And difficult. ~~

~~It was perfect. ~~

~~Now, we just had to fill it with interesting people.~~

~~It was a rag tag crew. But we all had one thing in common: we were doing things. Not talking about things. Actually doing things. Not necessarily things that made money. But making things. Building things. And trying to actually get stuff done. All of us commonly driven by the frustration that Portland had a tendency to be a town where untold hours could be spent talking about what needed to happen or what opportunities existed. And then would talk about it some more. And then more. ~~

~~Without ever actually doing anything. ~~

~~And that became the primary selection criteria for the coworking space when people approached us. "What are you building?"~~

~~> Why are we doing this? ~~

~~> Because we don’t have all the answers. Because we believe that the people who collaborate to innovate will win. And innovation is core to the business at W+K and for our brand partners. The brand and technology mentors that have come together around PIE, the ability to scale an idea across multiple brands with massive reach and off-the-chart awareness scores, interaction with other startups and W+K involvement is something you can’t get anywhere else but here, and that’s the result of a lot of people who believe PIE represents something truly unique, both for the industry and for Portland.~~

~~> “[Filling in some more details on PIE](http://siliconflorist.com/2011/07/28/filling-details-pie/)” Silicon Florist (July 28, 2011)~~

~~It started, quite simply, as a coworking space for a handful of people from the Portland tech and startup community. Not all were tech startup founders. Some were just solitary outposts for companies like Twitter or Kickstarter. Others were building small consultancies. A handful of folks were building tech companies.~~

~~But they were all doing something. ~~

~~There were bloggers. And early stage founders. There were community builders. There were telecommuters. There were product companies. And service companies. ~~

~~But they were all doing something. Not just talking. Doing.~~

~~We worked with what we had and did very little in the way of tenant improvements. W+K decorated the space with an air of startup edginess. Closet door desks on welded sawhorses. A repurposed Starbucks sign became our coffee table. Highback leather chairs from a local second hand store became our intentionally ironic conference room. ~~

~~![PIE's iconic highback leather chairs](/source/images/pie-highback-leather-chairs.jpg) ~~

~~The first winter, the heat didn't work. So we typed away in fingerless gloves. Watching clouds of our own breath. ~~

~~We were respectful of one another, but we focused on business first. And getting shit done. ~~
~~  ~~
~~Some folks would sit at their desks and take calls. Others would look for quiet corners. Or walk around the block. ~~

~~There was no privacy. So when we needed it, we took calls from the stoop. Which was only slightly colder than the interior during the winter. ~~

~~PIE began as a utilitarian space designed to do not only what the residents wanted, but what the community wanted. The space had an open floor plan. Which allowed the number of people to ebb and flow without needing to retool. It also enabled us to cram a bunch of folks in there when we needed. Or to tear down the space for speakers and events. ~~

~~We did everything from host speakers to user groups to hackathons to inviting hundreds of folks from DjangoCon to cram into the space as part of a code sprint. ~~

~~But it wasn't just businessing. We held happy hours. We served as an art gallery on "First Thursday"s. We hosted Minecraft gatherings. Basically, we tried to make the space accessible by having a policy of allowing people to stop by whenever they wanted or needed — whether they had work to do or not.~~

~~We even cleared the space out completely early in PIE's existence to create three soundstages for a 30-hour live streamed telethon put on by members of the community.  ~~

~~We had watched the concept of coworking develop in the Bay Area. And took part as the concept spread to Portland and other areas. We had been participants, residents, and customers of previous spaces. But we still really didn't have any idea what might work and what would not. So we just picked price point and tried it.~~

~~At this point, W+K was providing the space gratis as part of the experiment. So any revenue generated could be used by PIE to further its objectives.~~

~~Given that we wanted the project to be communal, we decided that any revenue would go back to a general fund for PIE activities, sponsorship, and food and beverage. We would also contribute a percentage of any joint projects — some of the folks in the space could collaborate on consulting gigs — to the PIE general fund.~~

~~And we wanted rising water to float all boats. So we introduced a concept that any company started at PIE would grant 1% common stock to PIE. It was our hope that this equity would provide PIE with a means of sustaining the business over time. ~~

~~From our experience with other coworking spaces, we realized that people generally charged for desks. So we started by charging $200 per desk. That quickly eroded. But that wasn’t a bad thing. It was all part of the experiment. ~~

~~Some startups managed to squeeze multiple people around a desk. That’s just smart. And it made that $200 go a lot farther. Some were given “scholarships” to sit in PIE rent free because we believed not only in what they were building, but in the founders, themselves. And all but a few skirted the 1% equity kick in. Not because they didn't want to. But mostly because we didn’t enforce it very strongly — or even do a good job of communicating that as an expectation.~~

~~That was our fault. Not theirs. ~~

~~Wary of organizations that talked and talked and never did, PIE was designed to be a place for people who were making things. Rather than talking about them. And in that vein we wanted to accomplish something before we went public with what we were doing. ~~

~~At least in theory. ~~

~~> We thought filling the space and starting to engage with W+K account teams was something. And so we started talking about it. ~~

~~> What we wanted was something that helped Portland startups—and by that, we meant revenue generating ventures—get going as quickly as possible. Less a coworking space and more an incubator. Something that helped people get going and then booted the project out of the nest to fly on its own. Something Y Combinator like. Something like TechStars. And yet, something uniquely Portland.~~

~~{[sidebar-getting-even-more-creative.md](sidebar-getting-even-more-creative.md)}~~


~~It wasn’t well received. Which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But it wasn't necessarily a good thing, either. There was some appropriate cynicism. And a healthy amount of questioning. With a few folks going so far as to categorize it as some carpetbagging or war profiteering move by Wieden+Kennedy. A way of the agency capitalizing on some grassroots activity in the Portland market. ~~

~~In short, the community immediately assumed that W+K was taking advantage of an opportunistic situation. ~~

~~I mean, the ire was somewhat understandable. Maybe not the unmitigated hate. But at least the ire. What the hell was this global creative agency doing dabbling in the world of startups? And why the sudden interest in Portland in particular? ~~

~~It didn’t help that, at the time, we were shallow on facts. And didn’t really have much detail to provide. Because we didn’t exactly know what we were doing. ~~

~~There simply wasn’t much there there.~~

~~We were naive in the most rudimentary sense of the term. But we continued the experiment anyway. And we went completely dark from a promotions and public relations standpoint. Until we had something more meaningful to say.~~

~~{[sidebar-fresh-pie.md](sidebar-fresh-pie.md)}~~

~~But perhaps most importantly, W+K had not been a significant part of the Portland startup community. And their sudden and intentional engagement — although seemingly ginger from the perspective of PIE participants — still ruffled feathers. ~~

~~Because W+K didn't engage the community where they were. They brought the community in. Before they were part of that community. Before the hospitality made sense. ~~

~~It was a mistake. But we worked as quickly and as diligently as we could to correct it.~~

~~We invited all kinds of random folks into the space — from interesting technology people to solo founders to early stage startups to individual contributors at companies like Automattic, Kickstarter, and Twitter. Heck, we even worked with a few early stage agencies. ~~

~~Just as important to the experiment we invited all kinds of people from Wieden+Kennedy to collaborate. ~~

~~We also invited the community to use the space. For hackathons. For events. For meetups. ~~

~~After roughly a year of observing the community, interacting with the PIE startups, observing their hardships, understanding their needs, and recognizing their opportunities, we stepped back and reassessed what we had accomplished. Or in our minds, what we had completely failed to accomplish. ~~

~~{[sidebar-pie-from-side-project-to-startup.md](sidebar-pie-from-side-project-to-startup.md)}~~

~~And so, with the blessing and backing of W+K, PIE transitioned from coworking space to accelerator, as a means of taking a more active role in the growth and development of these promising companies.~~

~~This book documents the learnings of that journey. A journey which, as of this writing, has resulted in a portfolio of more than 40 companies which have created more than 600 jobs and put more than $150 million to work in the Portland startup scene. Making PIE one of the more successful startup accelerators in the world.~~

~~By sharing the learnings from PIE, we have had the opportunity to work with a number of other accelerators around the world—corporate accelerators, innovation centers, R&D shops, for-profits, nonprofits, private, public, and everything in between—all of which have their own unique ways of managing their programs. ~~

~~We even took our learnings and cofounded a sister accelerator focused on the world of digital storytelling called Oregon Story Board. Story Board has served as a way for us to test our PIE learnings within a different target market. With a different type of creative. And to explore new ways of accelerating creative output.~~

~~Not bad for an experiment. ~~

~~Now let’s get you working on your own. And hopefully doing this whole accelerator thing way better than we have.~~

~~				10. (via @nohorse) "One of the things I always appreciated about PIE was that it felt like it embodies the spirit of collaboration in Portland. For example PIE seems at home in Centrl Office. It's likely something that is obvious to folks who have spent a while in Portland or Austin, but it's slow to sink in to some cities. There is a value in supporting other business incubators, maker spaces, coworking spaces, in your city and build a web of trust where everyone can feel safe and supported. Competition in the classic capitalistic sense is toxic to the young businesses that need as much help and support as they can to get off the ground and should never need to feel like they are picking brands or picking sides and potentially burning bridges to get the help they need. It might seem obvious to the cookbook authors, but it's worth explaining as it's a new concept to many folks."~~

~~# Drawing inspiration from other chefs~~

~~There are a benefits to starting something after people have already tested the waters. You’re getting the chance to take advantage of learnings from predecessors to inform the organization you’re trying to build. ~~

~~We tried to do the same thing. But when we started thinking about PIE as an accelerator, we weren’t quite as lucky. Much like when we started the coworking space, there were few models from which to select—and none of them had proven whether the model would actually pencil out. (Many of them still haven’t.) ~~

~~So we just had to take our best guess from the available options. But unlike you with hundreds of successful accelerator programs from which to choose, we had, well, two. Those two models were still in their early existence but they made the most sense to us. And seemed most in line with what we were trying to accomplish. So we took a risk. And tried to glean as much as we could from what they were doing and apply those concepts to our program.~~

~~Now the names of our inspirational chefs — our Julia Child and James Beard as it were — aren’t going to be surprising to you, in this day and age. The two programs we chose to serve as role models were — now obvious thanks to their continued success — Y Combinator and TechStars. ~~

~~Things weren’t as obvious back then as they are today. There was little indication at that time that these two entities would become the juggernauts of startup acceleration that they are today. ~~

~~We just got lucky. ~~

~~Note: This is a recurring theme.~~

~~Looking back, we also made a decidedly important decision by accident. ~~

~~You see, we knew we couldn’t recreate the perceived effectiveness of either of those programs, wholesale. Because we didn’t have all of the necessary ingredients at our disposal. Nor were we in a region that would provide all of those elements. ~~

~~So rather than selecting one program after which to pattern ourselves in a cookie-cutter fashion we chose to instead dissect each program and take only the elements which we felt best resonated with our audience—and that we had a chance of effectively emulating.~~

~~That is, it did us no good to strive to set up the program up as the onramp to the Silicon Valley elite and a bevy of investors—because we didn’t have the access that would have enabled this. Instead, we took only the parts of each program we had the ingredients to effectively recreate. ~~

~~# RECIPES~~
~~# Before you begin~~

~~## Want to start an accelerator? Don't start an accelerator~~

~~You don't get to start in the middle. You have to start at the beginning.~~

~~When we started the experiment with Wieden+Kennedy that would become PIE, we didn't set out to build an accelerator. We started with something to support the existing startup community. Something that would fill gaps that were preventing our community from growing and thriving. Something that would enable connections and random collisions and happily serendipitous events to occur. ~~

~~Honestly, we just kind of stumbled into this whole accelerator thing. It wasn't even on our list of objectives when we started. Or part of the conversation. It's just where we wound up for a time. But oddly enough — even though we never set out to build an accelerator — we managed to build a very effective one.~~

~~This is a recurring theme. That we will touch on time and time again in this book. Throughout PIE's life, we have been part of an ongoing series of happy accidents. But that, itself, is no accident. We designed the project to work that way. To never take itself too seriously. And to always be open to changing the recipe. Even if staying the course seemed safe and sane. To always pushing the envelope, exploring the edges, and not getting comfortable. ~~

~~It's not hard. You can do this too. And if you need help, we'll be happy to give you a nudge from time to time. ~~

~~PIE is an experiment. ~~

~~Starting with the relationship between Wieden+Kennedy and the Portland startup community. And kind of just continuing to cascade from there.~~

~~Well, honestly, to be more accurate, it was less an experiment in the traditional sense a more a whole bunch of mistakes, failures, and missteps that happen to be punctuated — here and there — by some very happy accidents. And we have lucked our way into some things — once the timing was right and all signs pointed to an opportunity — that enabled us to solve problems for the Portland startup community. By identifying gaps and then building something to satisfy that gap. Again and again. And we're still trying to do that.~~

~~Simple, right? Well, sort of. Simple, but convoluted. So maybe give us the opportunity to be your accidental sherpa. To help you along a similarly incongruous — but beneficial — path.~~

~~But do get the best results, you have to be similarly inclined to risk, fail, and misstep. If you're looking for a recipe that will always have you creating successful accelerator class after accelerator class using our simple recipe, you're reading the wrong book. Because like the communities, startups, and entrepreneurially minded folks you're looking to help, this process is a series of best guesses and iterations. And you have to be comfortable with that. ~~

~~If we had started with an accelerator, we're confident that PIE would have failed. Miserably. And that's why we're recommending that — if you're thinking about starting an accelerator — you do anything but that.~~

~~## Start at the beginning~~

~~So if starting with an accelerator isn't the right place, where should folks begin? Well, if you skipped straight to the recipes, how about you go back and read the timeline of PIE's existence. Maybe it will give you some clues as to what's coming next. And maybe you'll find commonality in your community that gives you a more appropriate starting place.~~

~~Or maybe, just maybe, you'll discover that you're one of the rare few who has already done all of the legwork. One who has completed all of the prerequisites. One of those lucky few strong communities that can, in fact, dive straight into the deep end of the pool. Because they've been ramping up all along. And now you're actually ready to take on that accelerator opportunity.~~

~~Don't start patting yourself on the back yet. There's still a ton of hard work ahead of you. But you can keep reading from here. You don't have to go back.~~

~~But if you're not there yet, please do not skip ahead. Do not pass go. There is no shortcut. It takes time.~~

~~## Building a startup accelerator in seven easy steps~~

~~tl;dr You're not starting an accelerator. You're helping to aggregate and strengthen an existing community.~~

~~### Step 1: Found your own company. Or at least work at a startup.~~

~~Per Brad Feld's advice in Startup Communities, if you're going to truly succeed in building a vibrant startup community then "the leaders have to be entrepreneurs." Not politicians. Not corporations. Not agencies. Or economic development bodies. Entrepreneurs.~~

~~With that in mind, we realize that PIE's journey started when the founders started working in startups. Sometimes as founders. Sometimes as employees of startups. But in startups. ~~

~~In the trenches, as it were. Experiencing the insanity that was the dotcom days, firsthand. Being wildly optimistic time and time again about how this time it was going to pay off. How all of the stock options would actually be worth something. How we were going to change the world.~~

~~Note: No one said you had to actually be a successful entrepreneur. Just an entrepreneur. ~~

~~On the surface, this is the price you pay for credibility.~~

~~But, more importantly, it's also this time — mired in the struggles of startups — that allows you to see the real problems and opportunities from the trenches. That provides the hindsight. That provides the what-if-ed-ness in your brain. That has rethinking every decision you ever made as a cofounder or employee or consultant. ~~

~~That has you thinking like a founder.~~

~~Because it's that direct startup experience that will inform the accelerator you want to build, eventually.~~

~~I mean, you don't get to build it right now. You've got a long ways to go before that happens. But eventually. When we get closer to your time to build the accelerator. Then. That's when this experience will really help.~~

~~But in the meantime, it will really help you engage and understand your community.~~

~~Also, let's not forget the most important aspect of that accelerator you're going to build sometime in the distant future after you get through all of the recipes. After you work your fingers to the bone building value for the community. Let's not forget that it's that time working with other startup types, meeting people, and building a network of intelligent and driven folks that becomes the most critical element of this first step. Because it's those people who will provide the foundation for a broader community. A community that will be critical to your accelerator. Because these are your colleagues, mentors, advisors, investors — and more often than not, your potential applicants.~~

~~But this takes more than winning at home. It's not just local community. Because building an accelerator requires variety and diversity. It takes more than just local flavor. It takes expansive and extended networks. And a multitude of viewpoints. And getting outside of your comfort zone.~~

~~So you have to do the hard work at home. But you also have to be out and about. Visiting other regions. Figuring out how other communities work. Making interesting connections. And bringing value to your community by connecting it to communities everywhere.~~

~~So yeah. A little bit of work. But you can do it. ~~

~~### Step 2: Participate in the community.~~

~~The most important part of beginning to build community isn't throwing the best parties or planning the biggest events. It isn't renting a massive space and inviting everyone to join you. It isn't bringing in dignitaries from around the globe and expecting the community to rally around you. ~~

~~Although you may be tempted to try all of these things.  ~~

~~The most important thing to do when starting to build and accelerate your intended community is to meet the existing community where it is, currently.~~

~~Maybe you don't think you have a current community. Maybe the current community isn't shaped like the community you want. Maybe you're unclear as to where this existing community gathers or communicates.~~

~~Get to work. ~~

~~Because we can guarantee — whether you think there is community or not — that there is community. Tons of it. It's just not evenly distributed. It's disconnected. Broken into different factions. It's in hidden pockets, here and there. Soloed. Presenting as something different than your archetypes.~~

~~But trust us. It's there. It's already there. ~~

~~And your challenge is to find it. And meet it. Where it lives.~~

~~PIE's founders attended coffee gatherings, happy hours, user groups, tech meet ups, startup discussions, open source gatherings, BarCamps, Ignites, unconferences, tradeshows, and on and on and on.~~

~~But we also did things far less organized and structured. Sometimes, we just sat in coffeeshops and struck up conversations with other laptop-wielding denizens. We talked to people both in Portland and outside of Portland. Because we needed that diverse network. And diversity of viewpoints. We tried to figure out what was going on and who was doing what.~~

~~Did we always fit in? No. Was it always successful? No. Was it clear we were getting any traction whatsoever? Absolutely not.~~

~~But we did it. And we did it on the community's turf. Not ours. We tried to provide value and get invited to their gatherings. We didn't egotistically start our own events. ~~

~~And in so doing — from that collaborative standpoint — we began to build the a network that would become the most critical component of PIE: a subset of an already vibrant community.~~

~~### Step 3: Talk about the community.~~

~~There's something about a tree falling and no one hearing it. Community is the same way. You have to talk about it. And blog about it. And tweet about it. You have to connect it. And highlight what it's doing.~~

~~Why? Because, for the most part, community is not immediately self-aware. As such, people don't just realize that there's "a community." Unless they're specifically looking for it. And this is true, even if they're deeply involved in that community. ~~

~~You have to tell them. And then tell them again. And again.~~

~~You have to cheerlead. You have to create a bully pulpit. And you have to use that megaphone to convince those outside of the community that the community is, in fact, real. And to encourage those who are starting to become self-aware of the community to connect more deeply with that community.~~

~~You saw folks like Brad Feld, Mark Suster, and Fred Wilson doing — and continue to do — this with their personal blogs. You saw Silicon Alley and Silicon Prairie and GeekWire do this with more journalistic efforts. And if you were in the same communities we were, you saw Michael Arrington do this with TechCrunch. To ridiculous effect. ~~

~~For us in Portland, those vehicles were things like Silicon Florist, our personal blogs, larger tech blogs outside of our region like TechCrunch, local publications, and the — then nascent — social media landscape. All served as the means of talking about the Portland startup community. And to spread the belief that it existed and had the potential to be much, much more.~~

~~Yes, Virginia, there is a Portland startup community.~~

~~Note: This step is ongoing. You don't get to stop talking about the community. Ever. Keep going. Keep talking.~~

~~### Step 4: Invite the community in.~~

~~Now that your community is gaining definition. Now that it is starting to solidify and formalize. Now that you are taking an active role within that community. Only now can you start to host events. Shine a spotlight on talented community members. And invite people who would benefit from hearing those community members. Renny did this by having W+K serve as the inaugural host of Ignite Portland. And hosting events like Portland Lunch 2.0, among others.~~

~~Without—and this is critical—expecting anything in return. At all.~~

~~Don't think that you have to acquire space before this happens. You can partner with existing spaces. Or pay to rent spaces that you make accessible to others. Or this can occur in a shared space or a known resource.~~

~~You don't have to own the space, but you must do what it takes to make space available to the community.~~
~~With PIE, we were lucky enough to own space. Which had been generously donated by our patron, W+K, as part of the experiment. So we hosted community gatherings that we didn't manage. We invited people into the space. We had them hold their events in our space. We let people crash out overnight for crazy caffeine fueled coding sessions. Heck, we even hosted the first ever 30 hour nonstop livestreamed Web telethon in the space to help the community raise money for charity during the holiday season.~~

~~We made the PIE space a resource by the community, for the community.~~

~~### Step 5: Create a common space.~~

~~Events are great. But truly valuable community spaces are leveraged as a utility, all day, every day.~~

~~For PIE, forming a coworking space was the way to go. In part because Wieden had given us the space to do it. And in part because we thought it was what our community needed. It ensured that the space was being used throughout the day while making it available for events in the evening. Plus it gave the space ongoing and sustainable energy. Everybody wins.~~

~~Maybe your community needs the same thing. Or maybe it simply needs an event space that it uses throughout the day. Or maybe it needs a coffeeshop or a brewpub. Who knows? Maybe it needs a multistory complex that houses everything from startups through established businesses.~~

~~We don't know what your community needs. It's your community. There is no right answer. Or, perhaps more appropriately, there is no one answer that is right for every community.~~
~~Your task is to find the answer that solves an actual need within your community. And to find the partners and patrons who are going to help you get there. You need to create the space that your community needs to continue to thrive. And to continue the momentum you, as a community, have created.~~

~~For us, the space in the Wieden+Kennedy building afforded us opportunities for coworking and hosting events—which in turn provided all kinds of value for the community. In retrospect, there are three things we found to be most important about having a physical space:~~

~~1. As different groups in the community took advantage of the space, it created an opportunity for random collisions to occur and serendipity to thrive—from W+K and giant global brands to nascent startups. We found that those collisions created real and sustainable connections.~~
~~2. It provided a vantage point for us—the startup community and our patron—to better understand the dynamics of the community, where the momentum was, and where the gaps were. At times, it also provided us with an opportunity to simply observe, as an objective third party.~~
~~3. It served as a physical representation of the community, as a whole. So when folks were visiting town or were new to town, they had a place to land. And that space enabled others to discover and engage with the community more readily.~~

~~### Step 6: Keep doing all of that stuff. But do more of it. Faster.~~

~~Now that you've got some momentum, you've got a working space, and you've started to define your role in the community, you have to really get to work. Or maybe you have to build something else. But you get the gist.~~

~~There's more to do.~~

~~In addition to hosting, you now get to start programming your own events. And using your network to make those events interesting, engaging, and valuable. But bear in mind, that this event programming has to occur in collaboration with — not in competition to — the events we mentioned in Steps 2 and 4.~~

~~It's incredibly important that these events fill gaps. Not replicate existing content.~~

~~With PIE, we created our own programming and invited folks to attend. We held hackathons that combined the startup community with the creative community and corporate community. We offered our space for coworking sessions for the "friends of PIE." Even if that meant giving space away.~~

~~In short, we were on the constant lookout for interesting opportunities to bring our networks together. For talks. For gatherings. And for all sorts of collaboration. Because connecting our disparate communities and adding value to the broader community is what helped us establish our space as valuable, needed, and sustainable.~~

~~And then, only then, were Renny and I ready to…~~

~~### Step 7: Start an accelerator.~~

~~Now that you've done all of that work, you're ready. I mean, if it's even still needed.~~

~~At PIE, we needed to start an accelerator. The community needed it. W+K needed it. Startups needed it. Individuals needed it. First a bullhorn. Then a coworking space. Then an accelerator. Because we needed it. As a community.~~

~~But if you discover it's not needed, that's okay too.~~

~~Again, this isn't the right way to do anything. This just happens to be how PIE came into being.~~
~~Please don't take this as a roadmap to try to recreate PIE. This is just an allegory. To serve as an example of one potential path.~~

~~Whatever you choose to do—start a long journey or jump into the deep end of the pool—just remember that, in the long run, you're not building an accelerator. You're building a community.~~


~~## Coworking and Community Development are not complementary~~

~~We’ve tried any number of models: paid desks, free desks, desks in trade. What has worked best for us, to date, has been the concept of free desks for “mentors in residence.” This is usually reserved for people who have been through the program, but it’s also been used for companies like Sprintly, Automattic (WordPress), and Upworthy. We established a soft baseline for participation (“You have to be actively engaged in mentoring startups in the space.”) And assessed and judged that participation anecdotally. Those not meeting our expectation were counseled to up their mentoring game or encouraged to leave the space. We gave them a few warnings.~~

~~Why do we believe this is an effective model for PIE and other accelerators? At the core, accelerators are about knowledge transfer. Retaining class participants beyond their cohort allows us to more efficiently transfer that knowledge (“You shouldn’t miss that mentor talk,” “You definitely need to connect with so and so,” and “I couldn’t help hearing you were having an issue with x. Here’s how we dealt with that.”)~~

~~It seems counterintuitive but we’ve learned that giving startups desks for free often creates a tighter bond and stronger commitment than asking them to pay. That is, they perceive more value in the offering than office space to be more valuable than simply cash out of pocket. They feel like a valued part of the community. And since a very important part of our role is strengthening community, we feel this emotional tie has far more value that the rent check.~~

~~Long story short, we feel we’ve gotten exponentially more value out of giving desks away than we ever would have by adding a few more dollars to the revenue stream.~~

~~	- Home away from home~~
~~	- Day-to-day~~

~~## Hosting events~~

~~Part of the appeal of hosting events is providing an opportunity for random, serendipitous collisions to occur by getting day-to-day coworking participants in the same room as members of the community whom they may not regularly encounter. ~~

~~For this reason, you should try to program the majority of the events with content that is tangentially or orthogonally related to the day-to-day pursuits of the coworking space. Members of the coworking space get to chat with one another on a regular basis. And that can create a bit of an echo chamber. ~~

~~These events should be striving to introduce speakers, topics, and communities that get the coworking companies thinking differently or, at the very least, more broadly. ~~

~~At PIE, we provided programming around the following topics~~

~~- Startup including legal and accounting~~
~~- Creative which featured talks like "Design for Developers" and "PR 101"~~
~~- Technical issues like specific technologies that were of interest to participants~~
~~- Hybrid events that combined several topics, like "How to manage developers" or "How to successfully engage with open source projects"~~
~~- Hackathons~~

~~# Kitchen Prep~~

~~Where you start is where you start. It might not be where you want to end up. But you've got to start somewhere.~~
~~- Environmental scan~~
~~	- Assess what's what before you begin~~
~~	- Start with reality~~
~~	- What assets/resources does your community have?~~
~~		- How mature are they?~~
~~		- Are they currently accessible?~~
~~	- Where are the gaps?~~
~~		- Are they solvable?~~
~~		- How entrenched are they?~~
~~	- Create one of those annoying Venn diagrams, because those things are a thing for a reason. They actually can help you visualize where the opportunity exists.~~
~~	- Then you can get visionary~~

~~## Definitions~~

~~We feel that it is extremely important to have a consistent set of language to describe the concepts and participants in this process. Without clear definitions, we run the risk of miscommunication — even when we think that we’re speaking the same language.~~

~~For that reason, we're going to provide you with some definitions of terms that are regularly used throughout the PIE Cookbook. Please note that, like all things in this document, we are simply providing this as a reference. We would encourage you to create your own set of definitions for your specific needs.~~

~~### Community~~
~~Community can refer to any group of individuals who hold common goals and are motivated to collaborate to achieve those goals. There is no specified size for a community. And communities can be nested within other communities — or overlap. Therefore, it is always important to test the assumptions of toward what the "community" is working.~~

~~> e.g., The Portland technology community has subsets like the Portland open source community and the Portland tech startup community. There is significant crossover between the open source community and the tech startup community, but they do not share exactly the same goals.~~

~~A community simply has to have a focus. It can revolve around concepts, ideals, goals, brands, or any combination thereof. We see community, at its essence, as a group of people with a shared, collaborative vision.~~

~~### Incubator~~
~~An incubator is a protected work environment designed to shelter founders and ideas as they work to realize concepts and prototypes. There is no "business" yet. There are simply ideas and potential. ~~

~~Incubators are designed to help early stage ideas survive longer than they would in the wild, independent of shelter. As such, an incubator does not accurately reflect the stressors and turmoil of the real world. Instead, it seeks to shield founders from reality by providing resources that best ensure its likelihood of finding commercial applications of its concept(s). This is by design.~~

~~> e.g., University tech transfer programs tend to be a good example of incubators~~

~~Although PIE has "incubator" in its name, that's a misnomer. We simply couldn't come up with a phrase that worked for PAELLA.~~

~~### Accelerator~~
~~An accelerator is a semi-protective environment that behaves as a microcosm of the real world, at a highly increased rate of speed. It is designed to help founders rapidly address issues impacting their businesses — and help them to better understand how to deal with personalities and adversity in the real world.  ~~

~~> Accelerators are not designed to protect founders from the elements of the startup world. They are designed to expose founders to those elements, time and time again in rapid succession. ~~

~~To quote Techstars, accelerators, by their very nature, are designed to help companies "do more, faster." They are designed to make founders uncomfortable. And to push founder to do and achieve more — or fail — more rapidly than they would be capable of on their own.~~

~~### Mentor~~
~~### Advisor~~

~~- - - -~~

~~# [SIDEBAR] Do you need a Mentor or do you need an Advisor?~~

~~Like many industries, the startup world is rife with terminology that holds special meaning to individuals who are well versed in its own cryptic lexicon. For that reason, we often fall into situations where we assume we’re on the same page as one of our similarly immersed counterparts. And — like most assumptions — that can cause problems. We believe that communication and clarity are vital, so we’re always looking for ways to get everyone speaking the same language.~~

~~One area of muddy definitions and confusion that we encounter time and time again is with “Mentors” and “Advisors.” In the vein of clarification, we thought we would take a few minutes to split hairs and explain the difference between these two roles, from a PIE perspective.~~

~~> The primary difference between a mentor and an advisor is that the former is chiefly tasked with providing opinions on problems and the latter is tasked with resolving those issues.~~

~~## Mentors~~

~~Obviously, as an early stage startup accelerator, we spend far more time with mentors than advisors. In our world, we define a Mentor as an individual who volunteers his or her time to provide a startup with opinions, criticism, and feedback on problems, opportunities, or quandaries.~~

~~Mentors tend to provide feedback in the form of “If I were in your shoes…”, “Here’s what I’d suggest…”, or “I remember being in a similar situation. Here’s how we handled it….”~~

~~Therefore, mentors should…~~

~~- Give first~~
~~- Volunteer their feedback free of charge~~
~~- Provide feedback on a wide range of issues and opportunities with the startup~~
~~- Speak from previous experience tempered with a knowledge of current market conditions~~
~~- Openly share mistakes and missteps from their past experience~~
~~- Remove their “brand hat” or “title” as needed, i.e., sometimes a mentor is “a CEO” and sometimes that same mentor is simply a “user,” “successful business person,” or “someone who has seen a lot.”~~
~~- Float in and out of a startup’s purview, enabling the mentor to provide fresh perspectives on problems as they change~~
~~- Be used en masse to simultaneously provide a variety of viewpoints on specific problems or opportunities — the more opinions, the better— even if it winds up causing the classic “[mentor whiplash](http://avc.com/2013/07/mentorinvestor-whiplash/)”~~

~~## Advisors~~

~~Conversely, we define an Advisor as an individual who is compensated —either in the form of equity or cash — by a startup in exchange for effort on solving a specific issue with the company or who is charged with assisting the founding team with a variety of issues.~~

~~Therefore, advisors should…~~

~~- Always be compensated for their efforts~~
~~- Work to earn that compensation~~
~~- Focus on specific areas that are in the advisor’s wheelhouse~~
~~- Provide strategic value to the startup that is recognizable to potential investors or other advisors~~
~~- Be expected to contribute effort to solving problems~~
~~- Be held accountable for contributing time to the helping a startup make progress or resolve issues~~
~~- Be used by the startup in a fashion that is equitable to the amount of compensation~~
~~- Provide more than advice or guidance~~
~~- Continue to provide value to the startup throughout their tenure~~

~~## Pick the right person for the job~~

~~To recap, if you’re working with a mentor, ask them for advice, not effort. They’re volunteers. They’re not being paid to help you. They’re providing their insights with the hopes that others will not have to suffer the same pains the mentor has.~~

~~If you’re working with an advisor, it’s fine to ask for advice, but you should also expect them to do work — and hold them accountable to that expectation. And you should recognize that they are a direct reflection on you and your company. Don’t take on advisors on a whim. Anymore so than you would take on a cofounder lightly.~~

~~Mentors volunteer; advisors are paid. Mentors advise; advisors work.~~

~~At PIE, we get a lot of questions about how to fund accelerator operations and investments. It makes sense. Finding the money that matches up with the opportunity is a challenge. It’s never easy. No matter how compelling the pitch. ~~

~~What are the objectives?~~

~~What is the expertise?~~

~~How can they help?~~

~~Can take several flavors (Note: This isn’t an exhaustive list. But it’s gives you a pretty good idea of where to look.)~~

~~In our observations, there are four types of folks who fund accelerators. Sometimes they’re actual, well, folks. Sometimes they’re companies. Sometimes they’re angels or venture capitalists. But here are the buckets into which they seem to fall.~~

~~### True patron~~
~~### Sponsor~~
~~### Partner~~
~~### Investor~~

~~On the upside, venture capital can be a very effective means of funding this sort of activity.~~

~~- Used to spending money on risky efforts~~
~~- Have a time horizon that is in line with company maturation~~
~~- Have the potential to provide follow on investment.~~
~~- Ongoing portfolio management can be super valuable for the continued success of your companies.~~

~~On the downside, this funding mechanism can curtail the experimental nature of an accelerator if VC is the only backing. ~~

~~- VCs are in the business of making money. ~~
~~- The relationship will be driven by financial motivations. Will likely be only interested in investing in. Companies that have the highest likelihood of returning capital to the fund. Companies that best match their investment thesis.~~

~~This sort of focus can hamstring accelerators and incubators who may see promise or opportunity in verticals or companies that are outside of the fund’s purview. ~~

~~Long story short, you don’t get to “experiment” with VC money. You get to make money.~~

~~# Mentoring the mentors~~

~~Around the time [PIE](http://piepdx.com/ "PIE") was starting the accelerator phase of this ongoing experiment, [David Cohen](http://twitter.com/davidcohen), cofounder of [TechStars](http://techstars.com/ "TechStars"), shared the [TechStars Mentor Manifesto](http://www.davidgcohen.com/2011/08/28/the-mentor-manifesto/ "TechStars Mentor Manifesto"). And it served as an inspiration for me. [A post by Micah Baldwin](http://learntoduck.com/techstars/good-mentor/ "8 Rules To Being A Good Techstars Mentor"), a former TechStars mentor , provided a similar nudge for me.~~

~~I’m often reminded to go back and reread both of these posts. And am inspired, again and again. So I thought I’d take the opportunity to augment the PIE mentor guidance a bit with some things that we’ve learned from observing PIE startups and mentors over the years.~~

~~We shared these tips with the PIE mentors and a few of them suggested we turn it into a blog post for the broader mentor community.~~

~~So we took that mentoring to heart.~~

~~If you’re thinking about becoming a mentor for startups — either in a formal accelerator program or independently — here are some tips for thinking about how to work with entrepreneurs.~~

~~## 10 tips for mentoring startups~~

~~### 1) Common sense is not common.~~

~~Mentors often worry that they need to come up with some earth-shattering insights to be of value. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Fact of the matter is that you spend day-in, day-out working in your area of expertise.~~

~~> You make intuitive leaps that are all but impossible without having had the experiences you’ve had.~~

~~All of that — all of that built up knowledge — is of incredible value to an entrepreneur who is in the middle of a maelstrom of activity. Or who hasn’t yet gained the experience. So think of the simple things. Think of the obvious. And share those insights.~~

~~Because your common sense is not common.~~

~~**“Common sense” is not common**~~

~~As I was working on my “Mentoring the Mentors” post for PIE, I recalled an older piece of mine where I dug into the whole “common sense” fallacy. It seemed timely and, potentially, helpful. So, I’m sharing some of those thoughts, after a little bit of refreshing the content.~~

~~> Common sense. It seems so, well, common.But fact of the matter is that it’s not.~~

~~I mean, common common sense is prevalent. I’ll give you that. Those widely held understandings. And things that most people seem to know. Sense that is common across a community or population. Yes, that exists. Common common sense is common.~~

~~But your common sense? Nope. Not common, at all.~~

~~You see, your common sense is different than everyone else’s common sense. And that’s because your common sense is based on the experience and insights that you have derived from doing the same thing, day in and day out. Or by being part of something for a period of time. Or from repeatedly trying, failing, and iterating.~~

~~> Your common sense is a byproduct of your focus, your vantage, and your experience.~~

~~And because of that, it is completely subjective. In fact, even if I were doing exactly the same thing you’re doing, day in and day out, the same things that are obvious to you wouldn’t necessarily be obvious to me. Even worse, I might have my own cadre of common sense that I thought you should already know.~~
~~Common sense is, counterintuitively, uncommon.~~

~~So that stuff that seems so obvious? It’s not. And that forehead-slapping “What is that person thinking? Isn’t it obvious that you do [or don’t do] that?” response you have on a regular basis? Whatever it is that is so painfully obvious to you may not even register for the person you’re observing.~~

~~Like it or not, we are all victims of the “curse of knowledge.” And that’s really difficult to shake. And it’s nearly impossible to unthink or unknow.~~

~~And that’s why, be it for business or mentoring or whatever, I am constantly challenged — and fail regularly — to do two things:~~

~~#### a) Stop assuming intuitive leaps have been made.~~

~~I have a really bad tendency to assume that everyone has already thought about what I’m thinking about. As such, I assume that they’re making the same intuitive leaps I am. So I don’t say anything. Or share thoughts.~~

~~The problem with this is that — more often than not — they aren’t making those leaps. It’s not because I’m smarter. (That, I can guarantee.) It’s just because I’m working with my set of common sense. So, even if it feels like I’m backtracking, I’m working to start with the reasoning behind my thinking. To ensure that everyone is on the same page.~~

~~What’s more, I’m really trying to focus on beginning at the introductory level — the 101 — and go from there. Without being pedantic or dismissive. Because you can’t just jump into the deep end of the pool and assume that everyone knows how to swim.~~

~~#### b) Over-communicating what I think I know.~~

~~If I’m not sure where my peers stand, then the onus is on me to be more effective at communicating. And I need to be more conscious and deliberate about sharing my opinions. No matter how small our company or our organization, we should be over-communicating when telling one another what is important, how we think things should be done, and how we have learned to get there.~~

~~Even better? We should be documenting what we know to provide a common lexicon for those discussions and a foundation for new folks entering the fray.~~
~~The value of our common sense lies in the very fact that we have produced it from our unique vantage. And because of that we need to, first, understand that it has very real and intrinsic value, even if we don’t perceive that it does. And second, we need to do a better job of sharing it and not assume that it’s common.~~

~~> We need to get away from assuming that “Everyone else knows this stuff. I’m nothing special.”~~

~~You know more about what you do than I do, or he does, or she does, or they do. In fact, we’re all incredibly ignorant of your unique flavor of common sense. And we would all be better off with you sharing those insights which you incorrectly assume we have already had.~~

~~> That thing that seems so completely obvious to you? It isn’t to the rest of us. Your common sense isn’t common.~~

~~### 2) Your mistakes are often more valuable than your successes.~~

~~While sharing your victories can be motivating for startups and entrepreneurs, being open about your failures and mistakes can often be more helpful. The stumbles and downfalls are the things that caused you to lose sleep, to stress, and to doubt. Share those. So that everyone can learn from them.~~

~~> Mistakes are why you changed what you were doing. Failures are the things that taught you how to do your job.~~

~~We always say that PIE is about “making new mistakes.” There are two reasons: 1) If startups are repeating mistakes our mentors have already made, we’re failing them and 2) If the startups go out and make new mistakes, then they can come back as mentors to prevent others from making those mistakes.~~

~~### 3) You don’t have to know everything.~~

~~You were asked to mentor because of your experience. And because you’re awesome. But that doesn’t mean you need to know everything. Nor does it mean the onus is on you to know everything.~~

~~> You know what you know. Share that.~~

~~You’ll be surprised at how seemingly simple things can drastically improve a startup’s potential and perspective.~~

~~### 4) You are more than your role or profession.~~

~~This one became especially clear with our corporate mentors. Sometimes, you have to take off your “brand hat” and put away your business card.~~

~~> Sometimes, your most valuable feedback comes not from what your company would say but from what you would say.~~

~~You are an incredibly talented individual who has made it to the position you’re in because of the decisions you’ve made. And its your insight and intellect that guided those decisions — that brought you to your current role. Sometimes, just being you and providing personal advice can be incredibly beneficial.~~

~~### 5) Know your limitations.~~

~~Don’t over promise. Don’t under deliver. And don’t get yourself into a mentoring situation that has you feeling stressed. An hour of your time is valuable. If that’s all you have to give, that’s all we’re asking you to give.~~

~~> Don’t make this a chore. Mentoring is a reward.~~

~~It’s the opportunity to share what you’ve learned. And to prevent others from making the mistakes you’ve made. It should be seen as such.~~

~~### 6) Advise as if you were an employee.~~

~~Mentors are often driven individuals who have attained their position through sheer determination and hard work. They’re often people who take the wheel and try to steer others in the right direction. And they’re used to leading.~~

~~> But your role here is not to lead. Your role is to advise.~~

~~And fact of the matter is that — no matter how vehemently you support or oppose an entrepreneur’s decision — in the end, it is his or her decision to make. Not yours. And s/he has to be the one to make it. Not you.~~

~~We take this from the vantage of an employee or consultant advising his or her superiors. “This is my opinion on what should be done, but you’re the boss.” Mostly because I’m fairly sure I’ll be working for one these entrepreneurs one day.~~

~~### 7) Be honest.~~

~~While mentoring can be a lot about bolstering the outlook for new entrepreneurs and motivating them to change the world, that’s not the goal of mentoring. The goal of mentoring is positive. But the path may not be.~~

~~> The most valuable mentoring comes from being honest. Not nice. But honest.~~

~~Sometimes, your feedback will be negative. Sometimes, your feedback will be difficult. But it should always be honest and critical — in both the positive and negative sense of the word.~~

~~### 8) You can’t fix everything. Nor should you.~~

~~You’re not here to rescue anyone. You’re here to provide startups with feedback. And you’re here to challenge them. That’s all we ask. If you want to take an entrepreneur under your wing, please feel free. But don’t feel obligated to solve their problems.~~

~~> Your job is to push startups to solve problems themselves.~~

~~More often than not, the problems you see haven’t even dawned on them yet. So tell them. But don’t try to fix the problems for them.~~

~~### 9) Take it personally.~~

~~We want you to be invested. We want you to be happy and frustrated and proud and confounded. We want you along for the roller coaster ride. We need you to take this personally.~~

~~> As a mentor, what comes from your gut and your heart is often more important than what comes from your brain.~~

~~At times, it will be completely aggravating. But that means you’re taking it personally. And that’s what these entrepreneurs need.~~

~~### 10) Mentor one another.~~

~~You’re not just here to give. You’re here to get. It’s a two-way street. So talk to other mentors. Get advice from the startups. Get advice from your peers. Get advice from anyone in the community.~~

~~> If you see another mentor in need of guidance — in need of your common sense — then pull them aside and share it.~~

~~And be equally willing to listen when another mentor wants to impart their knowledge to you.~~

~~**Good luck. And thank you for giving back.**~~

~~# Notes on mentoring~~

~~"Accelerator" can be a misnomer, in some cases. Accelerators are actually about slowing down, making connections, and contributing to community. They're about making busy people focus. About creating lines where there are only dots. ~~

~~If they accelerate anything, they accelerate connection. For both those mentors who choose to participate. As well as for the founders who are selected. ~~

~~We need to stop focusing on accelerating business and spend far more time and energy accelerating connections and value. For founders. And for our community. ~~

~~Mentorship is messy. And honest. And weird. Because it is human. ~~

~~It does not scale. It cannot be automated. And yet, if left to its own devices, it won't happen. Mentorship rarely happens organically.~~

~~It doesn't have metrics. Or milestones. Or process.~~

~~But it does have technique. It does have examples. And guidelines. And guardrails. For both the mentors and those being mentored. And for peers.~~

~~## In Practice (via @eighteyes)~~
~~Mentoring is an alignment of perspective. Here, you have to take the life experiences of another person, and have them understand your perspective. As a mentor, you must take the time to know a person, how a person thinks, what their experience is. A handy way to approach this is to speak about complicated material in the form of metaphors.~~

~~### Metaphors are powerful teaching tools (via @eighteyes)~~
~~Think about when you have learned a difficult subject. When it started, you had a slight familiarity with the subject, say 20% of the related material was understood. Here you stumbled around in the dark, with prior knowledge and experience as a candle lighting the way. Then you find it, that one critical insight your mind needed to begin to understand the other 80%.~~

~~Metaphors can help to provide that critical insight by bridging the experience gap using imagination.~~

~~> Example: 'Marketing is like a river. It is comprised of millions of little efforts, or drops, which gather in different channels, or tributaries, to bring customers to your business, like cargo to port'~~

~~From here, you have a framework to begin to explain the practices of Marketing to someone with no experience. This is done by translating the language of a particular industry into a reference they are familiar with so you can begin to have a conversation about more abstract topics.~~

~~### Industry Language (via @eighteyes)~~
~~As professionals, we depend on language to determine the expertise of others and evaluate our own progress. If a designer is talking about figure-ground relationships, while a data scientist is talking about k-clustering, they each may have a passing familiarity with the expertise of the other, but not the deep experience necessary to truly understand what it means to work with these ideas. ~~

~~As a mentor, is important to have a deep understanding of one or several subject matters, and a conversational familiarity with others. These are all touchpoints where you can convey your experience to someone else, using terms and ideas they already understand.~~

~~### Share freely (via @eighteyes)~~
~~Entrepreneurship often involves the challenge of connecting discrete ideas, so during a mentorship it is extremely important to share whatever information seems relevant, even if it is not topical to the established mentoring relationship. Knowledge does not fit neatly into boxes, it broadly crosses many connections. You never know what may `click` for someone else, it is best to flow with the conversation instead of following a script.~~

~~### Learn Openly (via @eighteyes)~~
~~One of the amazing things about people is that everyone sees their own connections and brings their own experiences. Young people especially, are more fluid in their thoughts, and have more free time to deeply pursue interests. Make time to listen, when you're scheduling time to talk. ~~

~~# Time commitment~~

~~Once you’ve chosen to work with a mentor, your most important job is to understand that mentor’s level of time commitment. Some mentors will want to help but have absolutely no time. Other mentors will be willing to show up for office hours several times a week. It runs the gamut. Your challenge is making the best use of the time they are willing to commit so that they are deriving value from their participation.~~

~~## Sliding scale~~

~~At PIE, we found the best way to help assess a mentor's availability was to present a sliding scale. Where the minimal level of commitment was fairly low and the maximum level of commitment was decided by the mentor. Just as importantly, we used other mentors as examples — which provided even more context for their potential engagement. ~~

~~Our lowest time commitment was "Be willing to grab coffee with one of our startups. Roughly 30 minutes. One time." That was it. ~~

~~At the upper end of the scale was "Hold office hours at PIE on a regular basis. Or just work out of the space regularly and be open to interruption. [Mentor name] at [Startup] has done this to great effect and is consistently one of our most popular mentors."~~

~~## Mutual respect~~

~~And if you do it right? You’ll find they’ll be a lot more willing to commit more time to the program in future class. Culture of trust and all that. ~~

~~Respect mentors’ time and they will repay that respect with more time.~~


~~# Speed dating vs Matchmaking~~

~~When it comes to mentor engagement, no topic is more ripe for discussion — and more likely to rile opinions — than the pros and cons of speed dating and matchmaking. But before we get into that, let's explain what we mean by the terms.~~

~~## Speed dating~~

~~With this format, either startup or mentor is assigned a location, usually a conference room or section of a larger worker area. The other party is then assigned the task of moving from station to station to meet with one another. This usually occurs on a very short timeframe, most commonly between 15 and 30 minutes. ~~

~~There is usually a smattering of mentor types, expertise, and skills in these situations, given people's busy schedules. It's often a "we'll take who we can get" approach. ~~

~~The process is designed to make efficient use of time for both mentors and startups, giving each party the chance to briefly meet the other. And to give mentors a general lay of the land for the cohort as a whole. It also avails the opportunity for each party to identify folks with whom they would like to be working.~~

~~## Matchmaking ~~

~~With matchmaking, introductions between startup and mentor are intentional, based on a series of factors, such as:~~
~~- Current problems plaguing the founders~~
~~- Stage of the product or company~~
~~- Skill set and expertise of the mentor~~
~~- Personality of the founders~~
~~- Personality of mentor~~
~~- Likelihood of availability~~

~~There is no set day or timeframe. Staff introduces the startup and mentor and leaves it the startup to schedule the meeting. Staff then follows up with both mentor and startup to understand the outcomes of the meeting and to help decide next steps. ~~

~~## So which is it? Both.~~

~~At PIE, we believe that each model has its pros and cons, which is why we have always opted to run a hybrid model. Most accelerators try to do the same. In my mentoring experience, however, more programs seem to lean more heavily on speed dating than matchmaking. ~~

~~# How to activate mentors~~

~~At PIE, we used four different means of activating mentors by getting them engaged with startups. How we worked with the mentors depended on both the mentor preference as well as the startup's or founder's immediate needs.~~

~~We’ll take you through each of these elements from least amount of engagement to most engagement between founder and mentor.~~

~~# Preparing mentors to speak to a class~~

~~One of the most important — and regularly occurring — activities of any shared coworking space accelerator is a mentor speaking to the class as a whole. For some accelerators, this can happen sporadically. For others, in can take place several times a week. ~~

~~At PIE, we found a cadence of two talks per week seemed to be the best. But if there were serendipitous opportunities — for example, a random mentor popping into the space or visiting Portland — we took the opportunity to have them speak. Variety, am I right?~~

~~## Initial misconceptions~~

~~In our experience, we've found that there are a few misconceptions some communities have about speakers. So we wanted to dispel those immediately.~~

~~### Mentors who want to speak are the mentors that should speak~~

~~Despite rumors to the contrary, there will likely be a large contingent of your community that actually enjoys presenting in front of an audience. They enjoy the stage. And they enjoy public speaking. And as your program — or programming — becomes more prominent and recognized, these folks will seek out your program. ~~

~~Sometimes they're amazing speakers. Sometimes they're not. There is value in each of those outcomes. ~~

~~Amazing speakers really help the startups. Not so amazing speakers can provide great conversation points for the startups and staff. ~~

~~But don't think you have to take all comers. Like so many things that happen in the chaotic environment of the accelerator, you have to determine if the timing is right. For the content. For the personality. And for the startups. Because wasting a good speaker at the wrong time is just as bad as having an off topic speaker at the wrong time.~~

~~### Mentors who don't want to speak shouldn't speak~~

~~While shouldn't you take all comers, the converse is also true. Sometimes, you have to seek out the mentor who doesn't want to present in front of the class. Because they have valuable insight. Or interesting stories. Or the startups simply need to have a little boost.~~

~~Act accordingly.~~

~~While it may take more cajoling and prepping, it is critically important that you always find the right speakers. Not just the speakers to which you have immediate access.~~

~~### Mentors need to be expert~~

~~Another misconception we will attempt to address time and time again is the idea that mentors need to be expert. We believe that anyone and everyone has the potential to be a mentor. Likewise, anyone and everyone has the potential to speak as a mentor. ~~

~~Expertise is not a prerequisite. Insights, willingness to share, and relatable stories are. So find the people who can talk honestly about their experiences. Whether they are considered "experts" or not.~~

~~### Speaking is more important than listening~~

~~We find that some of our best mentor speakers are those who spend less time presenting and more time conversing or purely listening. So make sure to find folks who are comfortable with that dynamic. ~~

~~You're much better off to have a so-so presentation with a lively Q&A session than to have a polished oratory followed by crickets. ~~

~~Startups are in your program to explore opportunities, question assumptions, and get their hands dirty. Not revel in theory. So make sure they have speakers who draw that conversation out.~~

~~### You need a formal setting for presentations~~

~~We talk to a lot of folks who dodge the whole speaker thing with, "Well, we don't have anywhere to do it."~~

~~Bullshit.~~

~~PIE's mentors had, arguably, one of the most thankless presentation platforms ever. A cavernous concrete room. With huge columns. And a scattered litany of desks. ~~

~~We made due. ~~

~~And I would argue that the very nature of the raw space lent itself to more candid discussions. That forcing founders to pull back from their desks and wheel their chairs away from obstructions caused them to be more engaged. That even those founders who remained intently typing away throughout the presentation gained something. Because they were immersed in the moment.~~

~~The best stage is the stage you have. Make due. ~~

~~## Coaching the mentors~~

~~Once you've selected a mentor to speak, it will benefit both the community and your program if you adequately prepare them for the talk. ~~

~~Even the most seasoned CEO with a completely polished pitch can become a babbling idiot when trying to describe how they built the business — or how they failed. But those are the stories that provide the most value to the startups you're trying to help.~~

~~### Encourage mentors to tell stories of failure and mistakes. ~~

~~Why? Simple. You can’t recreate the same success. But you can avoid the same mistakes.~~

~~Any founder could tell you the entire journey of his or her successful company — step by step in intricate detail. You could take scrupulous notes, ask for clarification and additional color, and document each and every step of the journey with complete precision. ~~

~~Then you could carefully, methodically follow that guideline, note for note. Without falter. Down to the most seemingly insignificant detail.~~

~~Would that enable you to launch a successful company exactly like that successful founder? Of course not. ~~

~~Because for all the control and precision — for all the efforts and decisions of the founder — there are an untold number of additional factors weighing on that success. Timing. The market. Collaborators. Whether it was raining or sunny. ~~

~~It could have been the market. It could have been the timing. It could have been, well, luck.~~

~~No matter how much you know about what led to success, you can never recreate it. And while those stories are great and inspirational and all that. Sometimes, they’re simply not helpful.~~

~~Now what if, instead, you explored things that failed? Would you fail in the exact same way? Probably.~~

~~Because failure is a different story. Knowing the story of failure will enable your startups to better understand how things go wrong, how bad decisions come about, and how those things can be avoided. Or, at the very least, they’ll know that similar decisions have a high likelihood of failure. And they can go into the situation with their eyes open.~~

~~Ask founders to talk about mistakes and failures? Won’t that be difficult? No. It won’t. And if it is then that’s likely a red flag that you have chosen poorly. Or the wounds are still too fresh. That you should save that mentor for sometime in the future. ~~

~~You see, entrepreneurs love the stories from the trenches. Because they're not actually stories about failure, at all. They're stories about perseverance.  To talk about how they battled against all odds to win. About how they managed to string things together and come out on top.~~

~~It’s part of the culture.~~

~~Talking about naive decisions and stumbles and screw ups. Sharing awful fucking mistakes. And heartbreaking failures. They aren’t pretty. But to other entrepreneurs they are way more important than recounting the completely random lucky set of circumstances that landed you where you are today.~~

~~Because unlike that celebrated and yet unrepeatable path to success, avoiding those failures and mistakes can be critical to your peers.~~

~~Wisdom isn’t always about winning. And if you’ve created an environment of trust in your accelerator, these stories will be pure gold to your startups. Or the sustenance that keeps them going.~~

~~### Trying to use this format as an educational platform is extremely challenging, if not ripe for failure (and not the kind of failure we want)~~

~~### Be prepared for Q&A to be awkward~~

~~### Being engaged is better than being polished~~

~~### Don't sweat the slides~~

~~### Don't make it a sales pitch~~

~~# Bad actors~~

~~One of the most challenging things about attempting to manage community — and then activating that community in the form of an accelerator — is the presence of bad actors.~~

~~When we say "bad actors," we mean individuals who are more interested in personal gain than the gain of the community or the founders in your program. It happens. Sometimes it's intentional. Often it's not. ~~

~~So how do you deal with it? ~~

~~Well, we recommend follow Brad's advice in Startup Communities. The community has to be open to everyone. You have to welcome everyone. And you have to build the type of community that rewards good behavior. And discourages bad behavior. ~~

~~But even with all of that working, bad actors still enter the fray. So what to do?~~

~~Honestly, from an accelerator standpoint, sometimes bad actors are more beneficial than one would think.~~

~~Let's provide an example. ~~

~~One class of PIE, we had arranged to have a serial founder come into to present to the class. The founder was currently employed by another company and, as such, took our invitation to mean we were interested in hearing about that company. And not the founder's journey with previous companies.~~

~~Shame on us for not setting the context correctly. Lesson learned.~~

~~With that misunderstanding as the impetus, things went from bad to worse. With and swirling schedule and multiple overlapping commitments, the founder canceled at the last minute. But rather than leaving us hanging, the founder decided to send an alternate speaker. The person the founder sent was a salesperson for the company.~~

~~So through no fault of the founder and no fault of the salesperson, we wound up in a bad actor situation. ~~

~~Our founders showed up dutifully to hear a founder talk about their experiences, challenges, and failures. But what they got, instead, found was a sales pitch for a product they neither wanted nor, honestly, needed.~~

~~And no matter how much staff would try to redirect the speaker — "Hey that's great. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what it's like to be in a sales role for this kind of company…?" — the sales pitch continued. "What do you do when an audience isn't receptive to your sales pitch?" Still continuing. "When do you walk away from a pitch?" And on and on. ~~

~~There was no derailing it. ~~

~~So when it was over, the staff scurried to tie it off and hustle the speaker out the door.~~

~~The PIE founders were, understandably, miffed. And any number of conversations were sparked by that experience. Some critical of the program for allowing it to happen. Some critical of the company and the former founder for sending that presenter. Some for the presenter not cluing into the environment. ~~

~~It became a running gag for the remainder of the class.~~

~~But you know what? It resulted in a lot of good conversations. A lot. Like an irritant creating a pearl, the poorly placed and unintentional bad actor had not only created a context for interesting discussion, the salesperson had unintentionally become a common enemy against which every one of the founders in that class could rail. ~~

~~It went from a negative to a teaching moment.~~

~~Best of all, it occurred in a safe environment. Somewhere that the founders could discuss what happened. Why it happened. And why it was bad. And that made it incredibly valuable on any number of fronts.~~

~~And with this happy accident it dawned on us that these founders were going to encounter these situations out in the wild. And now they would be better equipped to handle them when they occurred. ~~

~~And so we started introducing bad actors intentionally. To recreate those interesting moments of conversation and learning.~~

~~# Recipes~~

~~## Beverages (community engagement)~~

~~A lot of folks dive into this whole accelerator thing thinking they can just start with the accelerator.~~

~~"Hey! Hey you! We’ve got an accelerator. Come get accelerated and stuff!"~~

~~It doesn’t work that way. Any more than starting your fancy dinner party with a big ol’ main course gets the conversation going. ~~

~~You need to do some work before hand. Not only in how you plan and invite participants, but in how you kick things off. You can't just dive right in.~~

~~That’s why you need to do some work warming up the crowd. And getting people to know one another before you try to create a more intimate setting like an accelerator. Because that's what an accelerator is. It's a environment of trust where founders feel comfortable. Where they are comfortable opening up. And being honest. Where they can feel vulnerable. ~~

~~That's actually what a good accelerator is. It's a support group. ~~

~~Trying to create this environment of trust — or some other permutation of what you believe an accelerator to be — without doing the pre-work will likely just end up being a bunch of people sitting around quietly chewing their food. Uncomfortably. And you’ll feel like a complete failure. ~~

~~Worst of all, so will the companies you're trying to help. ~~

~~So how do you break the ice? The secret is community. Behind every good accelerator is a good community. Behind every failed accelerator is… well, no one. Because they didn't have any community. ~~

~~So how do you work with the community to build the accelerator you want to build? Here are some recipes based on our experience at PIE that helped us get the conversation going before we dove into the accelerator.~~

~~It's like the cocktail hour before the main course. ~~


~~Attending events~~
~~Online presence~~
~~Social~~
~~Blog~~

~~## Hors d'oeuvre (Hackathons, events, coworking)~~


~~## Main course (Accelerator)~~
~~### Culture/brand of the accelerator~~
~~#### Have a thesis~~

~~You don't have to be married to it forever and it can change as often as you want. But you need one. Your thesis can be defined by market dynamics, community trends, the expertise of your mentors, the success of your startups, the desires of your patron, or any combination thereof.~~

~~At PIE, we hit upon the fact that we were really good at accelerating platforms and enabling technology. Why did we get good at this? There were any number of reasons.~~

~~Portland has a culture of platforms and enabling technologies~~

~~We inherited the culture of the agency itself moreso than the cultures of the agency's clients.~~

~~Our mentors had expertise in building platforms.~~

~~Our startups happened to be focused on platforms.~~

~~The risk tolerance profile for the Portland community favored platforms and enabling technologies over consumer plays because the perceived risks and challenges are lesser.~~

~~We started PIE just as both the SaaS and mobile markets were exploding~~

~~#### Know where you suck~~

~~Know — don’t assume; know — what you are truly good at doing.~~

~~And even more importantly? Be willing to admit where you suck.~~

~~At PIE, it quickly became obvious that we sucked at helping startups with fundraising. We were hamstrung by several things.~~

~~First, there was a nascent investment community in Portland. ~~

~~Second, the community that happened to exist did not possess a complementary risk profile for the companies with whom we were working. Because of that, the local investors had little appetite for the types of companies as investments. ~~

~~Third, we had not established adequate ties with investors in other regions. We had friends here and there, but we didn’t have a strong rolodex of investors whose theses matched our startup profiles.~~

~~But you know what? Admitting we sucked at that — and being open with our applicants that we sucked at that — freed us up to be better at any number of other things. And made us way better and more focused on the things we were good at doing. Not only that, but it provide us with yet another measure by which to select the companies we chose.~~

~~## Onboarding ~~

~~One of the biggest mistakes most accelerators make — and we've made it a few times — is with onboarding. Or, to put it another way, assuming that participants realize what the accelerator is designed to do, what resources are available, and how to make best use of those resources.~~

~~If you're building an early stage tech accelerator, you can sometimes skate by without doing a great deal of onboarding. And just get lucky. ~~

~~Why? Because most early stage tech companies are familiar with the concept of accelerators. They know what they are designed to do. And they understand, at a high level, what they're supposed to get out of the accelerator.~~

~~Other industries? Not so much. The accelerator is not a common concept. So  we've found that assuming folks will know how to engage is a huge mistake. You have to tell them.~~

~~# Give the startups context~~

~~It’s important to recognize that this is a large transition for your companies.  Some might have even relocated completely to participate in your program. And if they haven’t, well, going from planning your own schedule and working out of a coffee shop, to a structured accelerator program is still a big transition.  ~~

~~Do what you can to help mitigate an issues your teams might have as they join you. Some welcome wagon items may include ~~
~~- Housing suggestions or referrals~~
~~- Maps of the city~~
~~- Information on public transportation~~
~~- Places to eat or grocery shop~~

~~What would you want to know if you were moving to a new city or even a new office? Your teams will want to know that too.~~

~~## Take it slow~~

~~We’ve found that too much scheduling the first few days can lead to a bumpy kickoff for companies starting the program. The first day of your program should be dedicated to introducing teams to one another, giving an office tour, letting people get settled and then finally, letting them get to work. ~~

~~We recommend providing documentation and creating some sort of reference for startups so they know what to expect as the program becomes more structured. It’ll also help them be clear on deadlines for deliverables and the expectations for them.~~

~~Here’s how we’ve used:~~
~~- [What you’re getting yourself in to](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-youre-getting-in-to.md) ~~
~~- [Woohoo! Here’s what to expect on your first day](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-to-expect.md). (Along with acceptance letter)~~

~~Consider providing these docs along with a welcome basket of swag.  Again, it’s about making folks feel welcome. The more comfortable your teams feel in the space the sooner they’ll be able to hit the ground running and work — and begin building up the trust that will enable them to succeed in this environment.~~

~~# Family Dinner~~

~~Arguably one of the most important parts of the program, family dinner is a weekly gathering exclusively for our company founders to come together, share status updates and gives guidance to one another over dinner. We’ve found that only talking about each other’s successes tends to discourage any folks who are further behind or have had a rough week, so we keep family dinner conversations strictly to topics where founders could use help and support.  Think of it as it a support group over dinner.~~

~~Having a gathering like this is crucial to the (mental) health of your program and founders and will deepen the connections between companies.  Peer mentoring is not something that can be forced, but in a setting like family dinner, it is only natural that folks will offer help to their fellow founders.~~
~~ ~~
~~Here are a few tips for how to effectively run a family dinner – because it’s not just as simple as ordering food.~~
~~ ~~
~~For a program of 6-8 companies, dinner usually run for an hour and a half.  Any longer than that and folks will start tuning out, and trust us, it will go longer than that if you’re not in control.  To avoid dinners that drag on, help your founders either cut to the chase, by calling out specific issues you know they’re having and could use help on or know when to politely cut folks off and move to the next company.  You don’t want to discourage any dialog that happens, but you do want to be mindful of everyone’s times.  Suggest they continue the conversation post dinner.~~
~~ ~~
~~As a management team, it is your responsibility to know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, to get your founders to open up.  Group sharing might not come naturally at first, so it is important to create a safe space to facilitate sharing.  Adopt the “what you hear at family dinner, stays at family dinner” motto or a Friend-DA. ~~
~~ ~~
~~These dinners are always open to past class, and if you’re running your dinners right, your alumni will be regulars.~~
~~ ~~
~~We recommend hosting your dinners on-site rather than at a restaurant, unless you can get a private room. Having the meal catered means it’s easier for folks to get up from their desk and join, rather than being tempted to go home and stay there before joining you at restaurant.~~
~~ ~~
~~Unless teams are traveling, consider family dinner mandatory.~~

~~## Family Dinner 0.9 Beta (Coworking version)~~

~~The original PIE Family Dinner had very little to do with dinner. It was held on a weekly basis — usually a Thursday around 4:00PM — and consisted of a group of folks grabbing a beer and sitting around chatting about what they were experiencing. We only called it Family Dinner because that's what YC called their gathering. And we liked the implications of family and strengthening the connections among the members of the PIE folks.~~

~~As far as participants, it tended to be a mixture of folks from early stage startups and other individual contributors working out of the space.  There were a few regular attendees. But the mix changed and morphed from week to week. Conversations ranged from business to personal life to business' impact on personal life.~~

~~Then something interesting began to happen. Rather than simply sitting around and engaging in small talk, folks began to share issues and problems they were having. They began to explore the stress and emotions of running a startup. And they began to shed the "entrepreneurial veneer" of "Everything is awesome!" to reveal what was really happening. And to start to ask for help.~~

~~## Family Dinner 1.0 (Coworking version)~~

~~As Family Dinner moved from Happy Hour to Reality Hour, something interesting began to happen. More folks attended. More folks participated. More folks shared. And more folks were encouraged to share. ~~
~~  ~~
~~> Rather than opting for voluntary participation, the weekly event became an exercise in peer mentoring. ~~

~~Each person who arrived was required to talk about what they were going through that week. In turn, other folks around the table were required to comment, critique, and collaborate to help that individual. Family Dinner began to solve problems — or identify problems as intractable. ~~

~~Family Dinner problems began to take three distinct forms:~~

~~1. Been there done that. An individual would highlight a problem that they had experienced. That problem had already been solved by someone else around the table. The two parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue. ~~
~~2. Now, that's interesting. An individual would raise an issue that no one had ever dealt with previously, and yet folks were motivated to solve collaboratively. Multiple parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue.~~
~~3. Stop. Do not pass Go. An individual would raise an issue that folks had tried to solve before, but it would be defined to be a completely intractable problems with no solution. Rather than continue to struggle, the individual would be encouraged to move on — or move around — that problem.~~

~~But it wasn't without its flaws. Some folks begin commanding more airtime than others. So we put a time limit on it. And enforced a requirement for everyone to talk. We tried to create a culture of collaboration. Where everyone was getting value out of the gathering. Not just a few squeaky wheels.~~

~~## The emotional ebb and flow of a stressful startup accelerator ~~

~~# Creating a cadence~~

~~One of the most critical roles for the accelerator staff is managing the cadence of the class. Both in terms of introducing stressors and pulling pressure-release valves, as necessary. ~~

~~There is no prescribed timing here. You add more pressure when it's needed. And you try to break the tension when it's needed. You just have to play it by ear.~~

~~That said, there are some clear guardrails to help guide this effort.~~

~~# Three months~~

~~PIE chose to run our program for a three month intensive period. ~~

~~We ran the first class for four and half months, and it seemed to be too long. So we shortened the program. Later, we'll get into why it seemed long. ~~

~~## Three months is a very short time~~

~~Most corporations, governments, and larger organization often question how we can possibly get anything effective done in three months. "Three months seems so short," they say. ~~

~~And it is. It's a short intensive period of incredibly stressful work. Piled on top of — or in the middle of — the long period of incredibly stressful and arduous work that is building a startup. (In all honesty, the accelerator period is the least stressful — and most supportive — of any of it.)~~

~~And if companies aren't careful, the three months can slip by very quickly. Too quickly. Without much to show for it. A few skipped mentor meetings. A talk or two. And suddenly it's Demo Day. Just like that. ~~

~~## Three months is a very long time~~

~~But fact of the matter is, when you're in the thick of it, three months is an incredibly long time. Especially when you're breaking it into minutes. ~~

~~![PIE's infamous countdown clock](/source/images/pie-countdown-clock.jpg)~~

~~From the time the first day of PIE starts until we bring the house lights down and Demo Day begins is about 130,000 minutes. And each one is critical. ~~

~~But no matter how motivated the founder, no matter how real the opportunity, no matter how passionate the team, it's a challenge to keep the momentum going. It's nearly impossible, over that length of time, to keep a sustained sprint going. It's like running toward a goal somewhere off in the distance. Like trying to realize a strategy without any tactics. ~~

~~So even those three seemingly short months have to be broken down into smaller chunks. To manage the cadence of the class. To manage the stress. To ensure — and endure — momentum. And perhaps, most importantly, to give the startups a sense of progress over the course of the class. ~~

~~By class three (Coconut Creme) we had learned to break the class into three marathons, each about a month a piece. A series of stages and gates that culminated in the performance at Demo Day. ~~

~~Throughout the course of these stages and gates, we tailor the mentor talks to match the topic — or to queue up the obvious need for the startups to focus on these particular topics.~~

~~Here's how we broke it out. We refer to it as "the three Ps": product, projections, and pitch. ~~

~~### Product (Month 1)~~

~~Because PIE classes generally consisted of groups of developers who understood how to build products, we started in a place of strength and confidence: product development. ~~

~~The challenge? Be ready to demo the current version of the company's product in front of the others startups in the class. The deadline was one month into the class. And it was a required activity. ~~

~~For some, this was a relatively simple request and in line with their product development schedules. For others, it required a great deal of effort to meet the milestone.~~

~~But that led to some interesting things, as well.~~

~~Those who were further ahead on product often discovered that they lacked the language to effectively convey what they were building. Worse yet, they sometimes that the current version of the product was difficult, if not impossible, to demo to a diverse audience. ~~

~~We get to question assumptions, clarify utility, and make suggestions, as a class. In a group environment. Companies get to respond directly to queries, jot down feature ideas, and generally scratch their head a great deal and ask "Why did we do it that way?"~~

~~So month one, get the product momentum going. And reward those who are making progress. Because that's going to be the crux of everything going forward. ~~

~~It's a safe place to start. Because we choose companies that have a solid developer or development team. And its gives both the developer and business cofounders the chance to show off what they're doing to a trusted group of peers. (After one month of accelerator stress, those bonds have already formed.)  ~~

~~### Projections (Month 2)~~

~~Product development, of course, continues throughout the course of the class — and for the life of the company. But we reduce the focus on that activity in month one. Giving the CTO/developer breathing room to resolve issues raised during the first month and work through the issues list as they prepare to release beta. ~~

~~Now that we've stressed out the developers, we put the stress on the business people. Who, more often than not, are developers learning how to business. ~~

~~And in our experience, nothing makes a business person feel more businessy than creating a spreadsheet with lots of dollar values in it. So that's exactly what we focus on during month two, projections.~~

~~We usually choose a 12 month window, because none of us know what's really going to happen in the future. But a year seems like a viable window to explore these numbers.~~

~~With projections, we experience the polar opposite of product. No one feels confident in their numbers. Most companies don't even know where to begin. ~~

~~To support, we offer templates, mentors, and office hours to help. But it usually doesn't. And it becomes a last minute scramble, rife with cries of "Do we really have to do this?"~~

~~The answer is "Yes." It's a required element of the class.~~

~~From this position of lacking confidence, the revealing of the projections to peers in the a group becomes a very different exercise. With the presenting founder often asking more questions than the audience.~~

~~"How did you do this?", "Does this seem realistic?", "What's missing?"~~

~~A second month of stress induced collaboration has heightened the trust among peers from a feeling of camaraderie to a dynamic of peer mentorship. And this is exactly what we're trying to engender. ~~

~~But this is generally a crushing demonstration, leaving the founders feeling exposed and confused. But it's a critical part of figuring out their business. And the strengthening of the class relationship, alone, is worth the friction.  ~~

~~### Pitch (Month 3)~~

~~Both product and projection development continue in month three. But now that we've established the context of what the team is building and what they need to do to succeed financially, we have established the focus of their pitch and the presentation they will be delivering at Demo Day. ~~

~~It's important to note that many programs choose to pitch throughout the course of the entire class. We've found this to have diminishing returns if run for longer than a month. It's also a good chunk of time which we feel is better focused on things like product and projections.~~

~~If the product demo is the area of the most confidence and projections are the area of least confidence, the pitch is somewhere in the middle. But it's often the most difficult to refine and finesse, so plan to spend a great deal of time doing it. ~~

~~At PIE, we played it by ear, with no fewer than two full group pitch practices per week. With individual staff, mentor, and peer-to-peer pitch practices rounding out the month of activity. ~~

~~We began with no slides, only story. Because it does no good to waste time building slides for a story that is going to change drastically anyway. We continue with no slides until we feel the stories are starting to solidify. Then we move to pitches with slides and story.~~

~~Group pitch practices are attended by all startups and staff. Mentors are invited to attend when and if they can. Presenters receive feedback from staff, peers, and their team members. ~~

~~But there is one distinct difference from the previous two milestones. The difference — and this is critically important — is that while previous presentations are a conversation among the presenter and the audience, this feedback loop is one way. The audience can critique the presentation, but the presenter cannot respond. ~~

~~Why? Well, we learned from our speaking coach mentor that this is a critical step in getting people to actually implement changes and improve their talks. You see, if they respond to the feedback, they subconsciously assume that they've fixed the problem. So don't let them respond. And they go and actually fix the problem.~~

~~Once the story and deck are starting to come together, start recording the presenters. Not only will it give them a valuable asset to review, it will present another stressor that breaks them out of their comfort zone.~~

~~Another piece of feedback we've received from the startups? ~~

~~The last week is pretty much nonstop practice, where we not only continue to finesse the story and the deck, but we start getting the presenter to give the pitch in the uniform that they plan to wear on stage. We've learned that the more we gradually attempt to mimic the environment and conditions they will experience on Demo Day — even if it can't be done perfectly — the better the presentations are.~~

~~If you can, take the opportunity to have the presenters practice in the venue. We've had difficulty doing this because of competing auditorium schedules. So for us, it's rare for startups to get the chance to practice on stage prior to day-of. We compensate two ways: We use the W+K auditorium space to practice and we get to the venue early on Demo Dy and do a few dry runs before the audience arrives. ~~

~~## Typical week in PIE~~

~~We often get asked, "What's a typical week like in an accelerator?" And while the term "typical week" is an oxymoron for PIE, there are some things that occur with enough regularity — and provide enough structure for participants — that we can describe them.~~

~~So here's an imperfect look at a typical week at PIE:~~

~~## Monday~~

~~8:00AM ~~
~~Staff arrives, meets about week's upcoming events. Some startups are already working.~~

~~10:00AM ~~
~~Workspace is full. All startups have arrived. Staff holds one-on-one meetings with each team. ~~

~~5:00PM~~
~~Family Dinner starts. Founders and staff leave the workspace to have dinner together. Non-founding team members remain in the space working. ~~

~~7:00PM ~~
~~Family Dinner ends. Startups return to workspace and continue working. Staff returns to space. Compares notes. Continues peer mentoring momentum from Family Dinner.~~

~~8:00PM Workspace is about half full with the founders who prefer the late shift. Staff remains online in the chat room or accessible via email.~~

~~## Tuesday~~

~~8:00AM Staff arrives. Continues making mentor connections for startups based on issues raised during family dinner. Typically two or three mentors per startup per issue. ~~

~~10:00AM Workspace is full.~~

~~12:00PM Catered lunch in the workspace. Some startups sit together and chat. Others simply eat at their desks. (Their is no required socializing. Just a request that the founders take time to eat.)~~

~~1:00PM Anecdotal founder story from a PIE mentor, followed by Q&A.~~

~~2:30PM Return to work. Mentors often remain behind to continue the conversation with a startup or two.~~

~~7:00PM Staff and startups start to thin out in the workspace. Staff remains online in the chat room or accessible via email.~~

~~## Wednesday~~

~~8:00AM Work day for startups and staff. Staff arrives. Checks in on progress. Spends day meeting with mentors, potential mentors, alums, and future recruits. ~~

~~10:00AM Startups working in the workspace.~~

~~11:00AM Random visitor pings staff. Staff invites the visitor to grab a desk and hang out in PIE for the day.~~

~~1:00PM Random visitor provides an informal talk and Q&A for startups.~~

~~2:30PM Startups working in workspace. Staff meetings with W+K account and creative teams. ~~

~~5:00PM Startups encouraged to attend a targeted community event and spend time networking with the rest of the Portland tech community. Staff suggests they drag the random visitor along for the ride. ~~

~~8:00PM Startups return to space and continue working and discuss event. Or opt to grab drinks with the random visitor.~~

~~## Thursday~~

~~8:00AM Staff arrives. Startups start to roll in.~~

~~12:00PM Catered lunch in the workspace. ~~

~~1:00PM Workshop based on common problem all startups are experiencing. Staff, mentors, and peer-to-peer engagement encouraged.~~

~~3:00PM Startups return to work. Small groups break off to work on issues that arose during the workshop.~~

~~7:00PM Staff departs. Space starts to clear out. ~~

~~## Friday~~

~~8:00AM Staff arrives. Startups start to roll in.~~

~~10:00AM Staff learns that there is an investor in town to meet with a PIE alum. Staff invites the investor to run the gauntlet. Investor agrees. Startups are given 15 minutes each to meet with the investor.~~

~~12:00PM Staff talks with startups about what happened, what went well, what could be better. ~~

~~4:00PM Happy Hour with PIE mentors, alums, and community members.~~

~~7:00PM Happy Hour winds down. Startups go back to work.~~

~~8:00PM Founders who clicked with the investor meet up to continue the conversation~~

~~## Saturday and Sunday~~

~~Staff and startups in space sporadically. No scheduled events.~~




~~				98. Curriculum~~
~~					105. More independent study than classroom~~
~~						106. Founders are extremely creative and driven, but they  are also intently focused on the immediate problem at hand. To them, nothing else matters but the problem they are working on right now today. Which, of course, tends to differ from startup to startup. And while those startups may _eventually_ all experience the same problem, they will not intuit that the problem exists until they encounter it. Therefore, it is our opinion that it is  nearly impossible to teach at scale in a classroom environment on an ongoing basis.~~
~~						107. However, do be on the lookout for opportunities where every startup is experiencing the same exact problem at the same exact time. Take advantage of those opportunities. But take advantage of them ad hoc, and on the fly.~~
~~						108. Some examples of these struggles that impact all founders simultaneously are learning how to meet, roughing out financial projections, pricing their product, and pitching.~~

~~**Advice for startups: Working with mentors**~~

~~Are you interested in engaging with mentors? Good. That's what we're here to do.~~

~~Here are a some tips:~~

~~## OVERALL~~
~~- These folks are volunteering their time because they want to give back to the community. Please be cognizant and respectful of this contribution.~~
~~- Please understand that while our program is a priority for them, they have day jobs and families and whatnot.~~
~~- Following the deep dive meetings, management has compiled a list of mentors who will be helpful to your startup. We will make those introductions on an ongoing basis. Please use one of the two methods below for engaging with those mentors.~~
~~- If you’re not finding mentors who meet your needs, please alert management with your concerns and we will recruit mentors to assist with your particular situation.~~
~~- Shit happens. Sometimes they’ll need to cancel and/or reschedule.~~

~~## OFFICE HOURS~~
~~- Keep tabs on the Office Hours page and be on the lookout for mentors who you find interesting ~~
~~- If management staff sees a mentor with office hours who would be beneficial for you, we’ll generally nudge you to set up some time.~~
~~- Once you’ve secured time, confirm the time and place via email. Mentors are busy and sometimes a single email gets lost in the fray.~~
~~- Do one last follow up/confirmation via email evening before/morning of your meeting.~~
~~- Following the Office Hours, send a follow up email touching on any salient points.~~
~~- Fill out the mentor feedback form~~
~~https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vwn3OQRAiZbGaDNYUt38BOkdPVqnmMG77qRLJMXFnW0/viewform~~

~~## AD HOC MENTOR MEETINGS~~

~~Need an intro?~~

~~The database was designed to be an easy way of searching through the mentor network. Feel free to search through and find folks who are of interest to you.~~

~~Ping management with requests for introduction or schedule time via mentor’s office hours~~

~~Once you’re introduced…~~

~~- Once management makes an email introduction, immediately follow up to schedule a time and place with the mentor.~~
~~- Do one last follow up/confirmation via email evening before/morning of your meeting.~~
~~- Following the Office Hours, send a follow up email touching on any salient points.~~
~~- Fill out the mentor feedback form~~

~~					~~
~~				99. Mentor engagement~~
~~					100. Formal~~
~~						101. Presentation with Q&A~~
~~							102. As we mention above, founders only care about the problem they’re experiencing today, right now. To further the disconnect, even if a mentor provides step-by-step instructions with excruciating details, the founder will never be able to recreate the steps, moments in time, or luck that founder had. ~~
~~							103. For this reason, we suggest that mentor presentations primarily be used as an anecdotal learning experience. Not a teaching one.~~
~~							104. Your primary objective with this format is to convince your founders that they, like the mentor, are capable of succeeding. ~~
~~							104. Mentors, therefore, should avoid chest thumping. They should be comfortable sharing stories of failure, mistakes, and missteps. Things the mentors wish they had done differently. Stories about how they got lucky. And things they wish they had known during their journey. ~~
~~							105. This allows the founders to extract the content that is important and relevant to their current frame of mind and ask clarifying questions as needed.~~
~~						100. Workshops~~

~~Lunch and Learns ~~

~~Sometimes a mentor talk, other times a workshop, lunch and learns are scheduled twice a week during the three month program during the lunch hour. Speakers can range from founders with anecdotal “war stories” to subject matter experts. We often bring our higher profiled mentors in for these talks, as it is easier to schedule for them. These are some of the most valuable learning opportunities of the program.~~
~~ ~~
~~Despite how straightforward these sessions sound, we’ve discovered a few snags. There is a chance that any given topic, might not be something a company is dealing with that particular day or week, but trust us, they will – and when they are dealing with it, they might not have a chance to meet with that mentor again. This is one of those; take advantage of the opportunity while you have it, moments.~~
~~ ~~
~~Teams will be busy and claim they just don’t have the time for another meeting.  Again, see above. These opportunities aren’t always on the table so they should be treated as such. ~~
~~ ~~
~~Active engagement is crucial for the companies and for the speakers.  A silent room means that your companies aren’t paying attention or asking questions and maybe even more importantly, it means that your speaker is wasting their time and becoming less and less likely to mentor for your program again. We ask our companies to step away from their machines and actively listen / take notes when during the session – it’s only an hour.~~
~~ ~~
~~Oh, and don’t forget to supply lunch – as it’s in the name and presents an opportunity for peer mentoring among the companies or a chance to talk more with the speaker. We’ve found it's best served before the talk.~~

~~This doesn’t have to be mentor led. This can be peer led. Some of the most interesting lunch and learns are peer led.~~

~~Example topics:~~
~~- Getting the most out of an accelerator~~
~~- Pricing Model roundtable – multiple mentors~~
~~- The importance of documentation  	~~
~~- Minimum “Valuable” Product~~
~~- Founder Talks~~
~~- Business Development 101~~
~~- Presenting 101 ~~
~~- PR 101~~

~~Encouraging bonding among peers ~~

~~This is an important part of our program and one that we feel is often overlooked by others.  We believe that we aren’t just graduating individual companies from our program, but collaborative groups who will improve and enhance our existing community. ~~

~~But this doesn't necessarily happen organically. It takes effort. And intent. That's why we've learned to put time into creating opportunities that enable those peer bonds to form, even on a short timescale. ~~

~~We've also learned that it’s important to use a range of bonding activities. A beer or cocktail is fine every once in a while, but it's important to break out of the startup stereotype. Plan activities that don’t just involve drinking. Heck, maybe even plan some activities that are healthy (gasp) or educational. ~~

~~The basic rule is: Be inclusive. And provide a range of options. Not every option will work for every participant. ~~

~~Below is a list of things we’ve done.~~
~~	~~
~~## Activity examples ~~

~~### Cooking class~~
~~With a name like PIE, it should come as little surprise that a number of our activities revolve around food. And when you have that much creative talent in one room, sometimes it's refreshing to give folks a different outlet for that creativity — especially one that doesn't involve banging on a keyboard. ~~

~~One activity that met both our food and creativity needs was a cooking class. For the first couple of years, we partnered with a local food accelerator that had commercial kitchen space. They put together a menu, taught our founders to prepare a dish from scratch, and then the entire group had the opportunity to share in the creations, family style. ~~

~~Everyone — no matter how well attuned they were to a kitchen — was out of his or her element. And it put everyone on equal footing. Best of all, there were always a few unexpected surprises when we discovered the true chefs in our midst.~~

~~Each year we did this resulted in the best family dinner of the class. ~~

~~### Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic ~~
~~### Away from the computer/office activities ~~
~~### Mixers + happy hours~~
~~we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc~~

~~### Family open house~~
~~a lot of program companies have families.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space~~

~~Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.~~


~~					112. Using shared experiences~~
~~						113. So much of what occurs in a startup accelerator is "independent study" where each company — and often each founder — has a unique experience in the accelerator.~~
~~						114. Family Dinner~~
~~						115. Lunch~~
~~						112. Pitch Practice~~
~~					108. Status reporting~~
~~					109. Check-ins~~
~~					110. Weekly reports~~
~~				111. Pressure valves~~
~~					112. Planned~~
~~						113. Happy Hour~~

~~# Demo Day ~~
~~## To Demo Day or not to Demo Day?~~
~~## Graduating from the program | DEMO DAY~~

~~Graduation requirements can be modified to fit your programs needs or specialities. Most, if not all, programs culminate with a demo day. Companies give a 6-8 minute pitches of their product in front of an audience that can be made up of a combination of stakeholders, investors, mentors, media, and/or community. ~~

~~We believe that the focus of demo day should be about gaining attention, not funding. Check don’t get written at demo days, but conversations get started. Your demo day can be as large or small, open or private, as makes sense for your program.  ~~

~~But while all of the above is true, it is important to understand that demo days are regularly occurring events, meaning, you’re going to work very hard to get attention from the media and investors, and you still might not get it. Their dance cards are typically full. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have one, because it’s important to have something that signifies the culmination of the program.~~

~~You should also consider the demo day goals of your teams and come up with ways to help them reach them.  Can you get the investors or potential new client they're courting at demo day?  Help them set up a dinner afterwards, or drinks even. ~~

~~The hand holding doesn’t stop just because they’ve gone on stage.  ~~

~~But on to the planning! Here is a look at how we handle ours, some suggestions, and some stats for context:~~

~~We believe it’s important to put just as much effort and energy into the event of demo day, as the companies put into their pitches. For many, this day signifies as their public launch and it is our responsibility to make their splash as big as it can be.  ~~


~~## Objectives~~
~~## Audience~~
~~- Investors~~
~~- Media~~
~~- Community~~
~~- Mentors~~
~~- Government~~
~~- Peers~~

~~- Sponsors~~


~~## Logistics~~

~~To help you stay on schedule, we're sharing this [PIE Demo Day: Run of Show document](/source/documents/pie-Demo-Day-Run-of-Show.xlsx).~~

~~### Invites~~
~~We manage our invites through Eventbrite and reserve groups of tickets for Investors, Media, Friends and Family, and Community. This enables us to control guest numbers within each group.  There is no cost to attend demo day, but you can make the invite password protected if that makes sense for your event.~~
~~ ~~
~~### Venue~~
~~Ideally you'll find one that that not only meets your needs for capacity, but can also handle the technical requirements you’ll have.  Make sure that your venue gives you time for walk-thrus with the presenters as well as rehearsal time. Bonus if you find one where you can host your post presentation reception (we’ll talk about those in a bit).  We had our first at a locally owned theatre and served popcorn.  We’ve since held it at a nicer venue.  The details are important here.  It’s like the saying goes, dress for the job you want to have – find a venue that matches the level you’re aiming for.~~

~~As a reference we used the main theatre and mezzanine for our reception here: http://www.pcs.org/rent-the-armory/~~

~~### Technical requirements~~
~~#### Number one rule~~
~~Set your presenters and your audience up for success.  Having the right equipment will make your presenters and your program feel more polished.~~

~~#### Projector + Screen~~
~~Make sure that the projector and the screen are large enough that any one in the house can see.  Set your screen up in a place on stage so that presenters aren’t standing right in front of their presentations. ~~

~~#### Confidence monitors~~
~~THESE ARE MANDATORY, or at least should be.  While we expect our speakers to be prepared for anything during their presentations, ya know, technical glitches, power outages, booing (kidding), we like to provide them with a little bit of a security blanket.  1 for current screen, 1 for presenter notes.~~

~~#### Lav + hand mics~~
~~Presenters should use lav mics, period.  This is especially crucial if they’re going to be transitioning their own slides via a clicker.  Too many things to hold and they’ll find themselves juggling.  Hand mics should be reserved for anyone doing presenter introductions or show opening and closing notes.  ~~

~~#### Wifi~~
~~A definite nice to have, but can get expensive if your venue isn’t equipped.  ~~

~~Livestreaming: Another nice to have.  We reach another 1000+ viewers by having a live stream of our demo day.  This is great for folks who don’t have time to make a trip just for your event, but would still like to participate.~~

~~#### Entertainment/music: ~~
~~Most demo days have their companies walk on stage to a theme song.  We like to take that up a notch and have a live band perform the song.  The band stays on stage and adds a little extra flavor to the whole show.  Year after year, we get a ton of compliments on the band.  If you can swing it, you should.~~

~~### What to wear:~~
~~We have teams wear logo branded t-shirts, each team has a different color.  Why do we do this? Well because after 1.5-2 hour long presentations, folks tend to forget names and faces, but can recognize a t-shirt color / logo that they wanted to talk to.  Trust us.  It makes a difference.  How do you decide what colors folks wear? Well, you can let them fight to death, or you can decide for them.  Logos are either black or white - keep it simple.~~

~~### Demo day swag:~~
~~Sigh.  You could do it, but do you wanna?  (inside joke ftw) It’s really not worth the time or the money to create swag specific to your demo day.  We know because we’ve done it.  We’ve even created awesome notebooks with pages dedicated to each team so that while they present the user could take notes on that teams specific page AND it had their business card attached to the page! Pure genius and a total waste of money that no one used or cared about.  ~~

~~### Post show reception (1.5 hours)~~
~~To facilitate conversations post presentations we host a private reception for our companies, media, and investors, immediately after curtain call.  Work with teams to find out who they’d like to attend and help make those introductions happen.  This is not a wrap party, but you should provide some bites and drinks. After all, the majority of the attendees just sat through an entire presentation. ~~

~~### Finally, food~~
~~Producing an event like demo day takes a lot of time.  Not only are you managing each individual company and making sure their presentation is ready, but you’re managing the entire show.  ~~

~~### Denouement: Repair to dinner~~
~~One of the things we tried time and time again was to get the startups to take mentors and potential investors out to dinner after the event. From giving them money to do so to planning their itinerary. It never really worked as expected, but we still think it's a great way of continuing the conversations in a more intimate environment. ~~

~~## Post mortem~~

~~If you’ve done your work on pitch practice correctly, your startups will be primed to turn the tables on you. ~~

~~> “You critiqued my pitch? Let me critique your job.” ~~

~~At PIE, we even couch it as such. Like pitch practice, PIE staff may not respond to any criticism during the post mortem. We can take notes and ask for clarification on feedback. But we are not permitted to try to explain away any blemishes the startups describe. Nor are we allowed to defend our actions.~~

~~Not saying that all of the feedback is negative. Quite the opposite. But after the first thirty minutes or so, the founders start to run out of niceties. And then they get down to provide the truly valuable feedback.~~

~~We receive feedback over the course of an hour to ninety minutes from each startup, preferably with all members of the founding team. If necessary, we meet with founders separately and then consolidate the feedback.~~

~~Then we look for common themes and concerns. We place role-specific elements into buckets. Like if the CTOs all referenced a particular aspect of the program. Or if the majority of the CEOs had a similar complaint.~~

~~We're looking for things that we need to change to make the program more effective. Not easier. Not less stressful. But more effective.~~

~~To this end, we can almost guarantee that one of the most consistent pieces of feedback you will receive throughout the post mortem process is “I wish you would have told us [x] sooner” or “If only I’d be taught [x] earlier in the class.” ~~

~~Rest easy. Had you told them any earlier, they wouldn’t have heard you. They would have ignored it. Or they would have believed that the problem would never affect them.~~

~~Don’t believe us? Try telling your next class earlier and see what happens.~~
